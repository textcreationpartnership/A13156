            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All the demonſtrations of their diſcipline are diſcifred, and ſtand confuted. they doe not ſo much as goe about to defend them. their whole plots of falſe diſcipline lye razed. they cannot ſay a word for them: in this late petition wherein they had occaſion to ſhewe their ſkill, they haue not ſo much as anſwered one argument brought by vs againſt them.<note place="margin">The defence of Bezamade for his Aldermen moſt weake, and ſimple.</note> as in a deſperate cauſe they haue intreated <hi>Beza</hi> to ſay ſomewhat. wherein we may ſee that their forces are ſpent to the laſt man. yea ſo ſpent, that they haue no hope of recouerie. for what ſaith he good man? hee telleth vs a long tale of his <hi>Geneuian</hi> deuiſes, hut neyther doth hee anſwere our arguments, nor bringeth ſcripture, fathers, or reaſon for his cauſe. vnleſſe wee beleeue him on his bare word, the controuerſie is at an end. call you this anſwering? this is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the playne ouerthrowe of his cauſe. for while hee went about to anſwere, he hath confirmed our cauſe ſaying nothing either for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or againſt vs, but what he in his olde age dreameth. where was <hi>T.C.</hi> that valiant champion of diſcipline all this while? where was <hi>W. Tr. W. Ch. D. Sp.</hi> could not one of them ſpeake for their cauſe, but they muſt ſend to <hi>Geneua</hi> for a ſpeaker? it is too great, and notable a confeſſion of the weakeneſſe of their cauſe.</p>
            <p>As for him, or (that I miſtake not) them that made the petition lately printed, and pretended to be preſented to her Maieſtie on the behalfe of the Puritans; they doe not deſerue the name of ſpeakers: vnleſſe it be among Puritans; where euery one that can prate, is ſayde to ſpeake. For what ſay they for their cauſe? their onely reaſon is, <hi>becauſe Caluin, Beza, Daneus, Carpentier, Golart, Perot, Tauergues, Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,
<pb facs="tcp:18450:4"/>Sneccan, and a number of other authors</hi> (of whoſe names and geſtes we ſhould neuer haue heard, if theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had not in this cauſe brought their names to light) <hi>doe ſpeake ſomewhat for their conſiſtorie, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to like of it.</hi> A goodly reaſon: yet ſuch a one, as I thinke they will not admitte againſt their diſcipline. For albeit Maſter R. M.B.M.G. M.A. M.H. M.D. M.W. and infinite other learned, and good preachers among vs, (yea ſuch, as one of them is to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt many of theſe ignorant and preſumptuous diſciplinarians) do like of the preſent gouernment: yet are they not therwith ſatiſfied. nay, albeit all the ancient Fathers, and acts of Counſels do like of the auctoritie &amp; gouernment of Biſhops: yet are theſe fellowes ſtil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending againſt it. That the ſame was eſtabliſhed by moſt learned and godly men, that in Q. Maries time gaue their liues for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the trueth, they litle weigh: nay, they neither care for them, nor their authoritie.</p>
            <p>With what face then can they alledge <hi>Golart, Pollan, Sneccan,</hi> and a number of birdes of like feather, and men neither wiſe nor learned, nor that haue ground of antiquitie or reaſon; ſeeing they renounce not onely the authoritie of our men more learned then they, but of our Martyrs more holy men then they: yea and all the writings of the Fathers, and actes of Counſels ſpeaking of the authoritie and ſtate of Biſhops, and ſuch a gouernment as we haue? In times paſt they were wont to tell vs of certaine lawes eſtabliſhed by God himſelfe; and made vante, that they would proue their diſcipline out of Gods word. Why then are they now mute? why are not theſe lawes, and this worde brought forth? why are they ſilent in bringing forth theſe mightie reaſons? when all is come to all, muſt we reſt on <hi>Golart, Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Tauergues</hi> and <hi>Sneccans,</hi> &amp; three or foure odde compagnions idle conceits? there can nothing be deuiſed more abſurd, nor ſenceleſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore hauing nothing to ſay in defence of their cauſe, now in a deſperate rage they begin to reuell not onely at Biſhops, but alſo at Lawes and Iudges, and the ordinarie tryals of this Realme. The drift of the petition is to ſhew, <hi>that</hi> Iohn Vdall <hi>was wrongfully condemned.</hi> they inſinuate therein, that <hi>the Iudges were either corrupted, or blinded, and that the euidence was wreſted.</hi> They ſay in plaine tearmes, <hi>that Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue no skill to deale with ſuch fellowes as</hi> Iohn Vdall: another kinde of man percaſe, then he is taken to be. Is hee trowe you any of <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets</hi> or <hi>Coppingers</hi> conſortes? to bring Biſhops into hatred, they haue
<pb facs="tcp:18450:5"/>after their petition collected diuers Articles, and by them and by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine calumnious interrogatories haue gone about to bring them in diſgrace with the multitude: that if they cannot haue their deſire of their celeſtiall conſiſtorie; they may be yet reuenged of ſuch, as they take to be the hinderers of their purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Whoſe malice to encounter, as before I haue anſwered their cauils againſt the eccleſiaſticall gouernment of our Church to the vtter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Conſiſtorie: ſo now hauing other occaſions to print a diſcourſe againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and forreine aduerſaries of our Church, I haue thought good to recreate my ſelfe with this more eaſie labour, and to anſwere their cauils at our proceedings in law, together with ſuch authorities as they bring for the proofe of their conſiſtorie, to the finall diſcouerie of their vnbrideled malice: that all ſeeing the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their cauſe may ioyne together to extirpate the reliques of thoſe, that haue bene cauſers of theſe ſtirres.</p>
            <p>Againſt this my purpoſe, I doe vnderſtand, that diuers exceptions are taken. Firſt, thoſe that fauour the conſiſtoriall diſcipline, doe ſay I withſtand a noble worke of reformation; and therefore cannot like of my doings. but vnto theſe this whole treatiſe ſhall make anſwere: for thereby it ſhall appeare, that their whole courſe tendeth rather to confuſion, and diſorder of Church and ſtate, then to reformation of eyther: and therefore ſeeing they doe declare themſelues open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both vnto the preſent ſtate, and to me in this cauſe, I doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what they like, or diſlike. no doubt, but that open enemies will like that beſt, which for the State is worſt, and greatly prayſe that, which tendeth to the hurt thereof.</p>
            <p>Others there are, that condemne all thoſe diſcourſes, that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of both ſides concerning this argument, which albeit they would ſeeme to be friendes: yet in deede are enemies, as well as the other. For no more is he an enemie that oppugneth vs in plaine fielde, then hee that trecherouſly ſeeketh to diſcourage ſuch as are forwarde in mainteining the State at home. and albeit they would colour their malice with pretence of deteſtation of contention among friendes: yet doe they vs wrong, to accompt them that oppugne the ſtate, friendes; or attribute the cauſe of contention to vs, that onely defend the State againſt contentious, and malcontent perſons, ſuch as would ruinate the ſame. for not thoſe that defend, but thoſe that begin the braule are contentious. Were it not thinke you a ridiculous thing for
<pb facs="tcp:18450:5"/>a man to ſay, that valiant men that fight for their countrey, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious; and a poynt of trecherie to diſcourage them? why then ſhould not the like bee thought of thoſe that condemne them that write in defence of the preſent gouernment, of religion, and learning, in like degree, as if they had writ againſt the ſame? Theſe men are ſorie that any ſhould ſtop the breach againſt ſuch, as ſeeke to enter to make ſpoyle, and therefore, as ſecret enemies, or weake perſons, that neither vnderſtand matters of State, nor reaſon, are to be contemned, if not reproued.</p>
            <p>A laſt ſort there is, that percaſe miſlike the ſharpeneſſe of my ſtile. but they muſt conſider, that in this diſcourſe I deale not againſt men of learning, or grauitie, or ſuch as deſire to learne, or finde out trueth: but againſt ignorant, wilfull, and ſeditious Libellers, that ſeeke partly by falſhood, and partly by diſgrace of ſome bad perſons vnworthy of their places to diſcredite the whole eccleſiaſtical ſtate: againſt whom no ſharpeneſſe of ſtile can be ſufficient. but I did reſpect rather what became me to ſpeake, then what they deſerued to heare.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe I preſent to your Lordſhip, a man well acquainted with the humors of the men, and weakeneſſe of their cauſe, &amp; a Iudge moſt skilfull in law. Vnto whom ſhould wee ſeeke for reſolution in law, and redreſſe of wrong, rather then to him that beareth ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a charge in matters of Iuſtice? vnder your name I would it ſhould come to the handes, and viewe of all other reuerend Iudges, learned Lawyers, and well affected ſubiectes. Wee deſire nothing more, then that matters may bee examined according to iuſtice, and doubt not, but if that may be obtayned, that the controuerſie will bee ended, and the calumnious mouthes of factious perſons ſtopped. for ſeeing the platformers haue neither ſupport of trueth, nor law; what man will doubt, but that they are to be repreſſed aſwell by Iuſtice, as by diſputation and diſcourſe?</p>
            <p>That is the meanes to ende all our complaynts, the remedie of our common griefes, if the perturbers of our State at home were firſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I would not doubt, but forrein aduerſaries would ſoone be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the mindes of friendes vnited, to the ioy of all that loue the trueth of Gods religion, and ſeeke the long continuance of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties peaceable reigne, and the floriſhing ſtate of the Church.</p>
            <p>Accept therefore I beſeech you, my good Lord, this my good will, which I teſtifie vnto you in this Treatiſe. Due it is to you, being ſo
<pb facs="tcp:18450:6"/>forwarde and vpright in matters of Iuſtice, and was expected at my handes being ſpecially touched in the petition which I anſwere, I make your Lordſhip and all the learned, yea all indifferent men iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Iudge therefore according to iuſtice and trueth. There is no reaſon I ſhould require fauour in this cauſe, further then my ſimple skill, and vnſufficient handling of matters for want of time, and being oppreſſed with other buſineſſe ſhall require fauour.</p>
            <p>The Lord ſend peace to his Church, and heape vpon you, and all others that loue his trueth, all heauenly graces, that by your meanes enioying the benefites of true religion, iuſtice and peace, wee may conſent in one trueth, and ioyntly in his holy Church glorifie Chriſt Ieſus the Prince of peace.</p>

            <head>The Preface wherein both the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſcourſe enſuing is deliuered, and certaine generall faults of the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, touched.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had once well hoped, that eyther the authoritie of the Magiſtrate could haue commanded, or the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the common enemie, that ſo violently doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle the whole Church at this time, would haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the contentious to make an ende of their braules: and if neither reuerence of ſuperiors, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of common profit could put them to ſilence; yet did I imagine, ſeeing they haue nothing to ſay, that diſcretion, and common ſenſe would make them to hold their peace. how much my expectation was deceiued this petition which I haue here vndertaken to anſwere, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. for without reſpect to lawes, or common profite, yea or common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the author thereof hath put forth himſelfe to ſpeake. a man as you ſhal ſee without reuerence to ſuperiours, or conſcience in reporting of lawes, or iudgementin matters diuine or humane, and moſt vnable to ſpeake, or write in this, or other argument.</p>
            <p>To goe no further, this his petition ſhall make proofe of my words. for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there art in his ſtile, nor witte, or ſharpeneſſe in his arguments, nor is there any decencie obſerued in the diſcourſe: nor doth the treatiſe agree with the title, nor the parts thereof with themſelues. the ſtile is like Iohn Bels ſong of Couentrie, the ſentences hang together like lenten deames: firſt, <hi>he kneeleth on his knee, then asketh pardon, afterward telleth of all good ſubiects, how they deſire peace (and yet notwithſtanding he telleth of many that increaſe contention,) then he talketh of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of bookes, of generall counſels, and a newe kind of diſputing by writing:</hi> matters that neyther haue coherence among themſelues, nor with his general purpoſe. hauing made this abſurd entrance, he proceedeth more abſurdly. his arguments are all drawen from authoritie, of late writers: a weake kind of reaſoning, and good for nothing: yet as if hee had ſayde very much ſtoutely doth he reuell at Biſhoppes, Iudges, lawes; and quarrelth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtate: afterward hee gathereth certaine notes of his owne diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which vnleſſe you receiue of his bare word, you ſtop all his glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: laſt of all he layeth downe certaine articles, and interrogatories. It
<pb facs="tcp:18450:7"/>ſhould ſeeme he hath bene eyther a pettie fogger in law, or a clerke in ſome office: or hath bene furniſhed with theſe matters by ſome odde clerke, or petie fogger. nothing is more ſimple, nor clerkely, nor worſe beſeeming men of learning. there is in his writing no good courſe of words, no good frame of ſentences, no ſufficient proofes, no order nor ſequence of parts.</p>
            <p>His arguments yet are worſe then his ſtile. to proue the conſiſtorie and his new conceits of diſcipline, he alledgeth firſt, <hi>that the gouernment of Byſhops is not ſo exquiſite, but that ſomewhat may bee amended.</hi> as if it followed becauſe men doo not their dueties, or becauſe there are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in men, and in proceedings, or want of ſome lawe: that the ſtate were to be ouerturned, and a newe vncouth and vnruly gouernement by Churchaldermen to be imbraced: or els, as if a man ſhould ſay, we were to be gouerned by the lawes of Turkes or Iewes, becauſe of the faultes of the common lawes. nay rather let lawes ſtand, and ſuch Turkiſh and barbarous conceites of generall innouation bee corrected, and faultes of lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>he bringeth in a packe of authorities againſt Romiſh bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops:</hi> as if eyther the ancient Biſhops of Rome, or the late Biſhoppes that preach the Goſpell, were to be meaſured by the wickedneſſe, and tyranny of the late Romiſh Byſhops: or gouernment were to be taken away, becauſe it hath bene abuſed. thirdly <hi>he produceth the opinions of</hi> Caluin, Beza, <hi>and a packe of</hi> others: moſt of them vnlearned and vnknowen, as if it were reaſon to follow them againſt all antiquitie; or as if the gouernement of the Church ſtood vpon opinion, not vpon ſcripture, and ancient lawes, and cuſtomes. Before times theſe fellowes told vs of a diſcipline commanded in ſcriptures; this fellow telleth vs of certaine fancies of <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> and certaine obſcure authors newly brought out of corners into light. and yet can he not ſhewe, that any of theſe whome he hath alledged, doe in all poynts conſent with our platformers. to prooue that his partiſans offend not againſt law, <hi>he alledgeth diuers of their opinions:</hi> as if it were an excuſe for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes to ſay, they beleeue well in ſome few poyntes. what puniſhment then do they deſerue that offend both in the opinions alledged, and diuers others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed? finally to prooue that his fellowes offending againſt lawe, are not to be puniſhed, <hi>he ſheweth that Biſhops alſo offend againſt Lawe:</hi> as if the offence of one, were to be an excuſe for another, or as if a man offend in any ſmall point of law, and that not of malice, it were lawfull for theſe fellowes to ouerthrow all lawes, and that of ſelfewill, and malicious purpoſe.</p>
            <p>There is no decorum obſerued in the whole diſcourſe, <hi>the petition is
<pb facs="tcp:18450:7"/>ſuppoſed to bee made by the author kneeling before her Maieſtie.</hi> yet doth he often ſpeake to others, and quarrell and diſpute with thoſe that are abſent, as if a man making his petition to her Maieſtie, ſhould ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſe vp, and quarrell with by ſtanders. which not onely is a poynt of abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, but of the authors old frenſie.</p>
            <p>Secondly what is more vnſeemely, then before the chiefe gouernour to plead as doth the petitioner; <hi>that all his gouernment is leud, &amp; antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and that his lawes are deuoyde of reaſon, and that iudgementes giuen are vniuſt, and ought to be reuerſed, and moſt odiouſly to raile on the ſtate and gouernours?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly ſeeing this petition is directed to her Maieſtie, to what ende is the ſame put in print? belike the mans purpoſe is, that ſo much as the Queene by wiſedome ſhall denie, the people by force, and furie ſhall eſtabliſh. which in deede is his drift. for the ſame was neuer preſented to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, but onely to the people.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, nothing is more abſurde, then to handle matters of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie by way of ſupplication. ſeeing he diſputeth, he ſhould rather haue come in ſchooles, then in court; and before lawyers, then courtiers.</p>
            <p>Laſtly a very vndecent thing it ſeemeth to me, that a man not conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in ſtudie of diuinitie ſhould teach diuines, that a diſordered companion ſhould controllgouernors, and lawes: that a man lately diſtracted of his wit ſhould teach law and order, neither knowing order, nor lawe. which courſe if it may be ſuffered: it is but folly to ſtudie diuinitie or lawe, or to maintaine gouernement; and a bad incouragement for iudges to do iustice, ſeeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ignorant &amp; diſordered companion ſhal take on him to control them and to teach lawe, &amp; to gouerne as it were by reuelation, inſpiration, and fancie. what ſhould be the cauſe that this baſe fellow ſhould come forth, I know not: vnleſſe this be it, that all that were wiſe foreſeeing and eſchewing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, this bedlem writer that neyther foreſawe, nor ſawe any thing, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with diuers collections of others, ſhould ſay ſomething, if for nothing els, yet to make ſhew, that they can ſay ſomewhat.</p>
            <p>The treatiſe anſwereth not to the title. for where hee promiſeth <hi>therein to deliuer a meanes how to compound matters;</hi> in the whole treatiſe he doth with all his force endeuour to enkindle warres, he rayleth on gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and lawes, controlleth iudges, and goeth about to reuerſe iudgements, and would if he could; ouerthrow all the eccleſiasticall ſtate: which ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rather of a humour to fight, then to compound. and yet is not he the man that must bee the leader of theſe conſistoriall warriours, being but a
<pb facs="tcp:18450:8"/>ragazzo fit for nothing but to cary baggage.</p>
            <p>In this his booke hee fighteth no more against vs, then against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. he ſayth <hi>hee will neither ſpeake to ouerthrow Biſhops, nor to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect conſiſtories:</hi> yet doth he his vttermoſt malice againſt Biſhops, and ſpeaketh what hee can for Conſistories: and yet nothing to purpoſe. hee <hi>profeſſeth hee knoweth not whether part hath better grounde,</hi> wherein like a ſimple fellow, he not onely confeſſeth he ſpeaketh of matters he vnderſtandeth not, but alſo contrarieth himſelfe in denying that hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth. in the very first entrance <hi>he ſaith, that all her Maieſties lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſubiectes, that loue religion, honour her Maieſtie, and doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the good of the Realme, doe heartily bewayle the contention of our Church:</hi> wherin hee pronounceth ſentence againſt himſelfe, and his conſortes, as neyther louing ber Maieſtie, religion nor the state. for ſeeking to enflame this contention by ſcurrilous libels, and interrogatories, how can it bee ſurmiſed, that they doe bewayle, this contention? do men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle, that which they doe? or doe men ſeeke peace, that against good men throw out their bolts, euen bitter and ſlanderous words?</p>
            <p>Beſides the former, the libeller hath alſo theſe faultes. moſt fouly hee abuſeth ſcriptures: moſt ſhamefully hee alledgeth authors, most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly hee talketh of lawe, and maliciouſly reuelleth at the eccleſiaſticall ſtate. in the first page hee abuſeth three places of ſcripture. the<note n="1" place="margin">Prouerb. 31.</note> wiſe man ſayth, <hi>open thy mouth for the dumbe &amp;c.</hi> by this place he would iuſtifie his babbling in this treatiſe. but nothing is more impertinent to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then this ſentence. for the wiſe man would haue innocents, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeake for themſelues defended by order, and iuſtice, by ſuch as can ſpeake. neyther may wee thinke, that it was his meaning, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſeditious perſon ſhoulde gape and rayle againſt Lawes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours for doing iuſtice, or that malefactours ſhoulde bee defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt lawe, and iudges. how can then this place agree to his purpoſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe men whome the libeller defendeth are not innocentes (for they were condemned for felonie, and tryed according to the lawes of England) neyther were they mute, when they reuelled againſt gouernours, nor was <hi>Iohn Vdall</hi> condemned, but for ſpeaking too much: nor is this buſie behauiour of this companion any way allowed, nor ſedition or libelling priutledged?</p>
            <p>The Prophet ſayth further,<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.</note> 
               <hi>that becauſe hee beleeued: therefore he ſpake.</hi> which the libeller turneth <hi>anſwere,</hi> and woulde drawe to this his treatiſe. but it fitteth not. for this petition is no anſwere, but rather a
<pb facs="tcp:18450:8"/>rayling libell, or challenge, neyther proceedeth it of faith, but of a fooliſh diſordered conceite of a diſtempered brayne, not yet well ſeaſoned, ſince the authors laſt bedlem fits. and if this bee his beliefe, then is his faith built vpon fancie, and vpon that which himſelfe confeſſeth, he knoweth not.</p>
            <p>Neyther doth it appertayne to his purpoſe, that the Prophet ſayth, <hi>that for Sions ſake he will not hold his peace.</hi> for it is not the cauſe of Sion,<note place="margin">Iſai. 62.</note> nor any good cauſe, but ſedition, faction, fancie, conceit, and opinion, that by him is here defended: &amp; that to the great ſcandale of all the watchmen of <hi>Sion,</hi> yea of althat pray for the peace of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> in the end of his articles againſt Biſhops, as if hee were rauiſhed in an ecſtaſie hee exclameth: <hi>how long Lord holy and true? and ſaith, come Lord Ieſu.</hi> which ſentences make much againſt him. for all good men deſire, that God would trie the cauſe and that he in iudgement would viſite the perturbers of this Church, which if once it ſhal pleaſe him to determine to doe, then ſhall hee and ſuch vipers as hee, that fret the bowels of the Church which nouriſheth them, be diſcouered, puniſhed, &amp; rooted out. theſe may ſerue you for a taſt. the reſt of his forgeries, and forcing of authors ſhalbe touched, as they ſhall offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their place.</p>
            <p>Neyther may wee thinke, that he that maketh ſo litle conſcience to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, or dally with the ſcriptures of God, hath vſed more religion in handling the writings of men. for example; to prooue the aldermen, of his Church, &amp; their proceedings, <hi>he hath alledged Luther, Zuinglius, Melancthon,</hi> and many others that are contrarie to theſe men in their diſcipline, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knewe ſuch aldermen, as he ſpeaketh of. neyther doth <hi>Caluin,</hi> nor <hi>Beza</hi> ioyne with him in his ſeuerall poynts of diſcipline. therefore doth he alledge them in groſſe, and abuſeth his readers with a ſhew of names. the like abuſe ſhall appeare in his quotations of lawe, which he by forging and lying maketh to ſpeake contrary to lawe.</p>
            <p>Little doth hee vnderſtand of lawe, hee neyther knoweth what procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of office meaneth, nor what is lawe in miniſtring of othes, against which hee argueth: neyther any one poynt of common, ciuill, or Canon lawe, of which hee ſo much standeth. but whatſoeuer his knowledge is in lawe, his malice in rayling againſt the ſtate is ſinguler: all which poyntes as they are touched here in a generalitie, ſo hereafter ſhall bee more particularly layde open, and moſt of his miſallegations, falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, malicious ſlaunders, weake proofes, and proceedings anſwered, not that eyther the author, whoſe inſufficiencie is notorious, nor the diſcourſe, the weakeneſſe whereof is too too pitifull, deſerueth any anſwere: but leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:18450:9"/>that the ſimplicitie of the ignorant, who is eaſily miſled with theſe great ſhewes might be abuſed, or iuſtice be by opinions controlled. herein alſo all men may vnderstand the weakenes of the cauſe of the Conſiſtorie, the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, malice, and faſhood of the Conſiſtorians, and ſuch as contend for it, and how fit it were, that ſuch as are altogether vncapable of reaſon, ſhould be gouerned, if not enforced by lawes.</p>
            <p>The author whatſoeuer he pretendeth for colour, propoſeth to himſelfe to proue diuerſe thinges: Firſt, <hi>that the Eccleſiaſticall gouernement of the Church of England is to be changed.</hi> for that doth he meane by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Secondly, <hi>That an Elderſhip ſhould be eſtabliſhed among vs, as being a gouernement vſed in the ancient Church, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be continued in all ages.</hi> and to the end that his reaſons may be weighed, <hi>he craueth diſputation by aduiſed writing.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth, that the diſciplinarian faction hath not offended againſt the ſtatute of 23. Eliz. c. 2, and that</hi> Iohn Vdal <hi>was vniuſtly condemned.</hi> Fourthly, he would declare, <hi>That the conſiſtoriall patrons are vniuſtly ſlaundered with deſire of innouation, and their doctrine with diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie or diſorder, and endeuoreth to excuſe himſelfe for not declaring himſelfe, nor ſetting his name to his petition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>by diuers Articles, and queſtions, he goeth about to bring the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate into enuie and hatred;</hi> That while men are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in examining their faultes, his clients of the new diſguiſed diſcipline may eſcape in the darke, and without danger vndermine the eſtate.</p>
            <p>To meete therfore with his malice, and to encounter him in al his turnes, I doe purpoſe by Gods grace to ſhewe; Firſt, that the gouernement of the Church of England is moſt conformable to the practiſe of the gouernment, both vnder the lawe, and the gospell, and hath teſtimonie of ſcriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of antiquitie, and was neuer gaineſaid, but of late dayes, when factious companions, and clouters, and tinkers, and marchants, and men of occcupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſpired to Church gouernement; and that the cauils and proofes brought by the petitioner againſt it, are fond and fooliſh:</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the noueltie, vanitie, iniustice, and inconueniences of the new gouernement are ſuch, as cannot ſtand with any good, or well ordered ſtate, wherein alſo the inſufficient pleading of the petitioner for the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie ſhall be refuted: thirdly, that <hi>Iohn Vdall</hi> was iuſtly condemned, and that the platformers are iuſtly charged not onely with breach of diuers lawes, very penall, but alſo with ſedition and faction; and therefore are moſt mercifully dealt withall, that they are nether in greater number, nor in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:18450:9"/>qualitie puniſhed; the vaine gloſſes, that are ſet vpon their factes, and opinions ſhall be there alſo wiped away. in the laſt part of this treatiſe, ſuch accuſations, as the libellor hath brought to diſgrace the Eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and which he hath ſet downe in malitious Articles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories ſhall be anſwered; neither doe I meane therein to omit any ſpeach, that ſhall ſeeme any way pertinent to purpoſe: being loth, he ſhould ſay, he was not anſwered.</p>
            <p>Wherein if you ſee no colour, or ſhew of reaſon for this newfound plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes; or proofe of his accuſation: conſider then I pray you firſt, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie hath ben offered by this libellor to the Church of God, to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and her lawes, to the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, and ſuch as liue in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of lawes: and ſecondly what they deſerue, that haue offered this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie vnto ſo many and honorable perſons, and brought this ſcandale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of God. the common<note n="1" place="margin">Reſcius i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It may be theſe felowes looked for anſwere of her Maiestie: and to ſay ſooth, the Magiſtrate were moſt fitte to ſhape aunſweres for ſuch diſordered petitions. but in the meane while it may pleaſe them to accept of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. they are no ſuch high perſons, but meaner men then her Maieſtie may anſwere them, &amp; reaſon it is ſeing they put their petition in print, they ſhould alſo receiue a printed anſwere: and ſeing they chalenge me, they ſhould heare my anſwere. And let them not thinke, but that howſoeuer their malice is repreſſed by lawe; their fond aſſertions and cauils ſhalbe refuted by reaſon.</p>

               <p>He ſhamefully likewiſe belyeth my lorde of Canterburie:<note n="2" place="margin">Pag. 654. lin. 54.</note> whom he falſely quoteth &amp; maketh to confeſſe elders. for ſuch elders, as theſe men would haue, neuer entred into his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18450:19"/>only he confeſſeth that there were miniſters in the beginning of the Church, that liued in community with biſhops: which now that the number of Chriſtians is ſo encreaſed were not requiſite. for then ſhould there be infinite nonreſidents. that he neuer imagined, there ought to be elders of the Geneuian making, his reaſons brought againſt them doe declare.</p>
               <p>Neyther did the author of the admonition made againſt the drunken ſurfet of Martins puritaniſme ſet downe any wordes, <hi>that import that there was an Elderſhip vnder the lawe, as the libeller affirmeth.</hi> the wordes are contrary, why then ſhould hee imagine that the authors meaning was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his wordes? it was ſaith hee, firſt ſo ſet downe. admit it were. muſt all compoſiters errors bee allowed for text? I perceiue theſe fellowes are angrie when a man woulde correct a fault. and therefore I feare hee will not amende his fault in lying. but I haue heard ſaith hee, <hi>that that booke was ſubſcribed by the biſhop of Canterburie, Lincolne, and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> as if any thing were more common then vntrueth in the mouthes of puritanes. and therefore no maruell if hee haue heard a leaſing.</p>
               <p>The author of the remonſtrance without any ſuppoſall ſaith plainely,<note place="margin">Pag. 166.</note> 
                  <hi>that there neuer were any Church conſiſtorie.</hi> and therefore what fondneſſe is it to ſuppoſe him to ſay, that which hee denieth? but admitte hee ſhoulde ſay, <hi>if it were in the lawe and Goſpell, that it were to bee continued:</hi> yet doth it not followe, that it was in the lawe or after. for of ſuppoſals no direct aſſertion can bee made, vnleſſe that which is ſuppoſed bee graunted. neyther can any man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force any ſuch concluſion, as the libeller imagineth. nay hee ſhall ſooner preſſe the little wit hee hath out of his braynes, then gayne ſuch a concluſion. for the aſſumption, <hi>viz. that the Geneuian Aldermanſhippe began vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lawe, and was practiſed vnder thè Goſpell,</hi> is but a franticke conceyte in this diſcraſied mans brayne. ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my lorde of Canterburie ſayth it, nor any of our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18450:19"/>ſide, that I knowe. Why doeth not the man therefore proue it? the reaſon is euident; for that vntrueth cannot be proued. let him therefore preſſe what he can out of the aſſertions aforeſaid: he ſhal ſooner wring vergis out of a flint, then wring his Conſiſtorie out of ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one Mathew Sutcliffe controlleth both.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto if he durſt haue ſet to his name, I might haue anſwered, that one <hi>W. St.</hi> and his promptors are deceiued. Now I muſt anſwere, that one certaine worthleſſe libeller miſtaketh: for neither is it true which he auoweth, <hi>That I proteſt there was neuer any ſuch gouernement by elders vnder the Goſpel</hi> (yea and ſuch arguments haue I ſet downe, that <hi>Th. Cartwr.</hi> and all the faction haue taken terme to anſwere) neither doe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trowle others, that haue trauailed before me in the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. for all of vs agree, <hi>that there was</hi> neuer any <hi>Geneuian Elderſhip</hi> in the world before the erection of it at <hi>Geneua,</hi> and that the Elderſhip, that was in time paſt, was compoſed of Biſhops, or of Prieſtes aſſiſtant to the Biſhops, which were Miniſters of the word and ſacraments: and ſuch, as in part in our cathedrall Churches yet continue. The third vntrueth is, <hi>That he ſaith, I ſuppoſe if there were Elders vnder the Goſpel, they were not now neceſſarie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 213.</note> which the author of the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance affirmeth. For I doe not ſpeake of Elders, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of gouernement; &amp; conclude moſt ſtrongly againſt the platformers, <hi>That they may not haue their diſcipline.</hi> and why? forſooth becauſe firſt, it was neuer found in ſcriptures, nor practiſe; and ſecondly, becauſe diuers orders are founde in ſcripture for externall gouernement, which now are out of vſe. ſo that both the antecedent being falſe, and conſequent nought, it is not poſſible the concluſion ſhould be good. but what ſhould I talke of antecedent and conſequent with this companion, that vnderſtandeth neither Logicke, nor termes of reaſon? The fourth lye is, <hi>that I deface forreine Churches, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Elderſhip in Latine, &amp; make the rent of our Church deeper.</hi> For I ſpeake in the defence of the ſtate, to ſalue thoſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18450:20"/>wounds, which theſe fellowes haue made, &amp; to pece the rents of our church. I neuer ſpeake of forreine churches but hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, neither am I curious in other mens ſtates neither doe I deale with <hi>Beza,</hi> but as with a graue and learned man in this point miſtaken, &amp; deſtitute in this cauſe both of wiſedomect learning: although I haue bene badly requited at his hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. which courſe if <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp; others would haue taken, theſe contentions that haue troubled our Church, woulde neuer haue growen to this height. but they would be writing, &amp; tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt vs, yea cenſuring vs with their conſiſtoriall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. and yet did we not deale againſt their churches. For that I wrote againſt the presbyterie, I did it in reſpect, that the ſame was obtruded to our church, by a certaine vnlearned, &amp; bold Italian. that I wrote in Latine, the cauſe was the Italians and <hi>Bezaes</hi> dealing for their presbyterie in Latine: and alſo to let others vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that our cauſe is ſuch, as we are able well to defend againſt <hi>Beza,</hi> and all conſiſtorials whatſoeuer. and therefore, ſeeing we meane not to obtrude our gouernement to them, and ſo profeſſe in our bookes, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> keepe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and make much of it, that it fal not to the ground. for it is in very weake caſe: &amp; <hi>Bezaes</hi> ſimple diſcourſe doth yeeld it no comfort. If any doe come forth to reply, I do proteſt, it is he that maketh the ſtirre, and not I. and therefore for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon eaſe it were beſt for al to keepe ſilence. but if they meane to prate of the glory of the conſiſtory, which our plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers eſteeme as an idoll: they muſt expect an anſwere and let not <hi>Beza</hi> thinke, that his fond diſputes againſt vs in his late three halfe penie pamphlet ſhall paſſe for oracles.</p>
               <p>To returne to the libeller, I anſwere, that neither is it true, that we handle the matter doubtfully (for we are all reſolued in our poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) nor that they hold their opinions reſolutely. for neither concerning the inſtitution, partes, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, nor office of their conſiſtorie doe any two of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: neither doth it ſeeme probable that euer they wil agree. they are at ſuch contention among themſelues. for neither
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18450:20"/>doe they knowe, what they would haue, nor wherefore. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I ſay, that this argument is moſt ſimple, and miſhapen. for ſuppoſe that two or three ſhould handle the cauſe of the Church ſimplie: it were no reaſon, for the ignorance, and ſimple dealing of two or three, that the Chuch ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturned, and that new lawes and lordings ſhoulde come in place. yet this is his wiſe concluſion, becauſe all doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all pointes, that the matter muſt be called in queſtion, and biſhops be diſplaced, that certaine coate cardes in ſhort ierkins may come in place to rule all, either by their diuine inſpiration, or elſe according as <hi>Th. Cartw.</hi> the oracle of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ſhall determine. which reaſon if it were admitted, then howſoeuer we reteine the preſent gouernement, yet ſhall wee for euer be diſcharged of the conſiſtorie: the patrons whereof contrarie one another moſt abſurdly in infinit places, &amp; write moſt irreſolutely, and ſtrangely. Laſtly, to bring the eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſtate into queſtion, <hi>He alledgeth firſt, that our lawes expect a further reformation; &amp; that ſuch as haue written againſt papiſtes, &amp; puritans, haue found imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in our gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> Which if he meane in the frame of our diſcipline, or in reſpect, that we haue biſhops, or want conſiſtories; he is abuſed. they neither expect ſuch a reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor auow any ſuch thing. by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtatute of <hi>K. Henry</hi> 8, power was giuen to 32 perſons to gather into one body ſuch lawes eccleſiaſtical, as were nether repugnant to the lawes of the realme, nor prerogatiue royall. That <hi>they had</hi> (as the petitioner ſaith) <hi>authoritie to correct good lawes, or to make new lawes, is the firſt vntrueth.</hi> The ſecond vn trueth is, <hi>That D. Cranmer &amp; other learned men did collecte the lawes into one booke.</hi> for the booke that came forth with the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Correctio legum Angliae,</hi> was gathered not by <hi>D. Cranmer</hi> but by <hi>D. Haddon.</hi> and that very ſimply; &amp; without iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, inſomuch as al men of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſliked it, &amp; afterward him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo was aſhamed of it. nay contrary to the authoritie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by ſtatute, he tooke vpon him not to gather lawes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but to gather a packe of new fancies together, and to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18450:21"/>make new lawes coontrarie to the Eccleſiaſticall lawes of the realme, yea contrarie to equitie and reaſon; as I ſhall iuſtifie, if any will challenge me for it. The lawes of nurſing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and marriages will verifie all that I ſay; yea, and his owne teſtimonie giuen of it. Laſt of all, the lawe whereby this collection of lawes was authoriſed, is now repealed, and not neceſſarie. For albeit all doe not: yet ſome knowe what is lawe. but ſuppoſe eccleſiaſtical lawes that are in force ſhould begathered together, doeth it therefore followe, that eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall lawes muſt be all changed? howſoeuer it is, let not the aldermen bragge of theſe lawes, for therein the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Biſhops is confirmed, &amp; churchaldermen not ſo much as mentioned: they muſt therefore looke in ſome other place. for in this booke, their Conſiſtorial conceites are not to be found.</p>
               <p>In the booke of Common prayer there is a <hi>Commination preſcribed to be vſed, vntil an order of diſcipline practiſed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church ſhould be reſtored.</hi> But what maketh that for the eſtabliſhment of the conſiſtoriall diſcipline, which was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the primitie Church, nor in the cogitation of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that booke? the meaning of the booke is onely, that the commination there mentioned, ſhoulde be vſed vntil ſuch time, as in the time of Lent offenders might be brought to humble themſelues, as they did in the primitiue Church, and that more fauour might be giuen to the execution of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical lawes, which is that diſcipline which they deſire, &amp; theſe felowes withſtand; and therefore hereafter I thinke wil not call for diſcipline. for if the ſame were once executed, then would not euery contentious perſon degorge his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt lawe, nor libellers and ſciſmatickes be ſuffered to declaime againſt the ſtate, nor euery vnlearned mate be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to preach falſe doctrine, and reuell at all antiquitie.</p>
               <p>Neither doeth it followe, <hi>becauſe in the ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters it is ſaide, take thou authoritie to preach the worde of God, that euery Miniſter is apointed a preacher, and that none are to be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18450:21"/>appointed Miniſters, but ſuch as can preach, which is that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,</hi> And this libeller affirmeth. for the exception which doth abbridge the lawe, is<note n="1" place="margin">This pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the law, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuile eſt. ff. de legebus.</hi>
                  </note> cautelouſly, and malitiouſly left out, wherein he ſheweth that his cauſe cannot ſtand, but by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and forcing. the wordes are, <hi>Take thou authoritie to preach, where thou ſhalt be ſo appointed.</hi> Theſe fellowes diſdaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; would runne before they be ſent: but vnleſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had more learning, and diſcretion: it were better, that ſome of thoſe that take on them to preach, were ſet to reade: and ſuch as runne ſo faſt, were made to ſit ſtill.</p>
               <p>In Flaunders according to the rules of this diſcipline, they would needes at the firſt haue euery one to preach: but when they ſawe the great inconuenience that came of it, they put them to reade <hi>Caluins homilies on Iob.</hi> but ſuppoſe that in the point of diſcipline of Lent, or in the number, and qualities of preachers, we haue not that we deſire; doeth it therefore followe, that the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate muſt be ruinated, and al lawes aboliſhed, that the confuſion of the Conſiſtorie, &amp; bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſme of this new diſcipline may triumph ouer the church? In <hi>France and Scotland</hi> they want much of that diſcipline they deſire: nay the Miniſters want meanes pore men to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and their families, yea &amp; the Church wanteth ſufficient, and learned miniſters, and is glad to vſe the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of boyes, and vnlearned youthes, wanting all thinges ſaue boldnes: yet they will not ſay, that for theſe diſorders, or want of their deſires, it is reaſon, that the miniſterie, and their aldermen ſhould be changed, and all ouerthrowen.</p>

               <p>The ſame reaſons may alſo perſwade vs, that there were no ſuch church gouernours in the Apoſtles times, or after. There appeareth firſt no inſtitution of them: Secondly, no lawes wherby they are to gouerne: Thirdly no act of theirs: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no commendation or reproofe of their perſons, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; Fiftly, their authoritie was inueſted in the Apoſtles by our Sauiour, to whom alſo the keyes were giuen, and not to theſe falſe aldermen, that come in rather like burners of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then gouernours of Churches with counterfeite keyes: Sixtly, in the whole ſtorie of the Acts of the Apoſtles there is not the leaſt ſuſpicion of them, neyther doe they ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing, but falſe interpretations of 3, or 4 places of ſcripture: Nor to conclude can any thing be more vnlikely, then that our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus the wiſedome of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen the keyes of Iuriſdiction, and knowledge to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and their ſucceſſors, would take the ſame from them, and hang them at the elbowes of men without authoritie, knowledge or diſcretion: ſuch as the Church Aldermen are for the moſt part.</p>
               <p>In the times ſucceeding next to the Apoſtles, all hiſtories, counſels, fathers, giue witneſſe to the gouernement by bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in time of perſecution: and after the time of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by biſhops, vnder the ſoueraigne direction of Chriſtian Princes. Neyther for 1540 yeeres did euer this fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit come in any mens heads, that merchantes, men of occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, muſterd ſellers, and tinkers, were men ſufficient for the gouernement of Churches. Then which nothing can be deuiſed more abſurd, nor inconuenient. It is the high way to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18450:25"/>all hereſies. for when matters be decided by voyces of men that neuer knewe Scriptures; Fathers, nor tongues, how is it poſſible that they ſhould teach trueth? or continue in trueth, or meete with errours? this is the principall cauſe of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of hereſies in the lowe Countries.</p>
               <p>The ſame alſo would be a Seminarie for ſchiſme. for when all pariſhes, and miniſters, and Conſiſtories haue equall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, as theſe fellowes teach that they ought to haue, who ſhall remedie contentions that fall out? the ſynode? a mere conceite. for what neede they to care for the ſynode, or the cenſures thereof, that by no lawe are ſubiect to ſynodes? All learning would decay: for who ſhould neede to ſtudie, if a Taylor comming warme from the ſhopboard be a man fit to gouerne the church? or who can haue any courage to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die where this ſacrilegious diſcipline that hath made hauock of all the reuenues of the church, is placed; and the ſtipends that are allotted to learded men ſhall bee arbitrary, and may bee taken away at the diſcretion of a ſort of ignorant mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchants, clownes, and men of occupation?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, where there is no lawe preſcribed, how can the Iudges bee kept in temper? euen now, notwithſtanding all lawes and penalties that may be deuiſed, partialitie, fauour, hatred and other affectons beare ſway. How much would they ſway more, if the Conſiſtorie ſhould come in place, which is ruled onely by will, and pluralitie of voyces, and not reſtrayned but by pretence of God worde, which euery man vſeth to conſtrue to his owne profit. Downe would the princes reuenues fall, and the Realme be left without meanes of defence, and made vnable to reſiſt the enemie. If any man thinke that the ſpoile of the church ſhould come to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hands, he abuſeth himſelfe. The ſpoyles of other places do teach vs, what would fall out: yea, our owne experience may herein ſufficiently inſtruct vs. For albeit in the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Abbeys the Prince had ſome ſhare: yet are not now the Princes of this land able to mainteine that force that in

Suppoſe then that the church goods ſhould come to ſpoyle: do you thinke they would be better ſpent? it ſhould ſeeme no: for all is now ſpent in ſurfet &amp; exceſſe, that in time paſt was ſpent in mainteining of men. And I knowe where, in certaine manors taken from biſhops, thouſands of men were mainteined: the reuenues of all which do not now buy peticoates for my miſtres the owners wife, and her may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, &amp; not a man of al their tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſcarce able to do her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſeruice at his owne charge, they are ſo fined &amp; ſkinned.</p>
               <p>All thoſe that liue by learning, ſhould be turned along to picke ſallets; whereby Poperie hauing no reſiſtance, would finde eaſie entrance, and thoſe that are beſt able, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged for want of meanes, make leaſt reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Vnto all theſe points the Libeller ſaith but litle: only vpon one point he ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, that the hot purſuers of their pretended reformation haue ſome induceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to thinke, <hi>that there hath bene in the world ſome ſuch conſiſtory as</hi> he imagineth, but where, or when, he knoweth no certaintie: nay he knoweth not what maner of beaſt the ſame is. His proofes they be ſo weake, that I marueile hee was not aſhamed to make muſter of them: ſcriptures he bringeth none. Aworld to ſee, how thoſe that in oppugning our ſtate were ſo copious in allegations of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to mainteine their Aldermen, and Diſcipline, doe not ſo much as endeuour to bring any ſcripture, or by reaſon drawen thence to confirme their cauſe. The Fathers, as him ſelfe confeſſeth, ſpeake obſcurely. his chiefe helpe is in <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin, Iunius, Beza, Dancau,</hi> yea and ſuch obſcure compagnions as <hi>Bertrand de loques, Bastinge, Charpentier, du Pleurre, Golart,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18450:26"/>Iacomot, Pollan,</hi> and a rable of others not worth the naming. But if the conſent of halfe a ſcore baſe writers, and of bad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy be ſo forcible, as to perſwade the good liking of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie; what reaſon haue wee to ſtand in defence of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment by biſhops, which hath the conſent of ſo many generall counſels, ſo many Fathers, ſo many ages, yea ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men alſo of our time as theſe bee, and as well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and godly as the other; diuers of whoſe pietie hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fiery tryals, and bene ſealed with their blood, namely Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> biſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> biſhop <hi>Latimer,</hi> biſhop <hi>Farrar,</hi> maſter <hi>Philpot,</hi> and maſter <hi>Bradford,</hi> and many moe martyrs that liued in good liking of our ſtate, and defended biſhops: whereas few of theſe that are alleadged condemned our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and none of the ancient Fathers allowe ſuch an Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as theſe ſeeke for? Adde hereunto the learned men now liuing in England comparable to the beſt, and farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe <hi>Baſtinges, Loquians, Golarts, Perots,</hi> and ſuch obſcure, and vnlearned, and vnwiſe authors.

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> to the ſame purpoſe: but his words fit not their turne: for he talketh of elders <hi>that managed the word, and fed with doctrine, and meaneth a ſynode of biſhops: or aſſembly of the miniſters of the worde</hi> (for thoſe are called preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents) <hi>and ſuch preſidents as dealt with the adminiſtration of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Of theſe new aldermen which ſtarting from their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, and ſtalles, runne raſhly into church gouernment, in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time there was no newes heard. That the Elders he talketh of were miniſters of the worde, &amp; adminiſtred the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of baptiſme, is apparant in his booke of baptiſme. ſo that alleadging that booke, the Libeller doeth nothing, but turne the poynt of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt his motley,<note n="2" place="margin">Tertul. de baptiſ. &amp; de coron. milit.</note> and party-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured aldermen. For in in him the worde <hi>Presbyteri</hi> ſignifieth alwayes miniſters of the word, ſubiect to the biſhop, &amp; neuer any men of trade or occupation vſurping Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and chalenging equall power with biſhops: as in the places aboue mentioned is euident.</p>
               <p>The places of <hi>Cyprian</hi> make no more for his purpoſe, then thoſe before alledged out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ignatius.</hi> In the 5 e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of his ſecond booke he <hi>declareth how he and his Collegues had ordained Aurelius a reader:</hi> but that by Collegues is meant biſhops, is apparant, for that biſhops did onely ordeine. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for that prieſts were not Collegues to biſhops; but ſubiect to them. Thirdly, for that prieſts of one church had not to do in another, but biſhops had. Fourthly becauſe hee neuer heard of, nor knewe any temporary prophane church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldermen, which were not miniſters of the worde and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Laſtly, for that he writeth to the elders ſuppoſed to be aldermen of the new creation, not to ioyne with him, but to declare what he had done. he would haue done otherwiſe, if prieſts had bene his Collegues.</p>
               <p>In another place he ſaith, <hi>he purpoſeth to doe nothing without the counſell of his Cleargie, and conſent of his people:</hi> but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing for the conſiſtorie. for in all lawes with vs the conſent of the people is adioyned; yet haue we no aldermen: <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:18450:27"/>the Conſiſtorie doeth things without conſent of the people, albeit the ſame conſiſteth of aldermen, And <hi>Cyprian,</hi> albeit he would not then do; yet ſometimes did, and might doe things by his owne authoritie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is one thing, <hi>to haue the counſell of men;</hi> another, <hi>to be ioyned in commiſson with them.</hi> for the Prince hath a counſel, but no ioynt nor equall gouernours. Laſtly theſe elders were miniſters of the worde, ſuch as reſiding now in Cathedrall churches, were then liuing in cities about biſhops.</p>
               <p>Vnto the wordes of <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his 18, and 22 epiſtle of his third booke, we will then yeelde anſwere, when we finde any of that nomber: for there are but 15 epiſtles in that boooke. But this is an ordinary fault of this fellow, to quote counſels, bookes, orations, and epiſtles that neuer were in the world.</p>
               <p>He alledgeth alſo the 5 &amp; 9 epiſtle of <hi>Cyprians</hi> fourth book: but in the 5 there is nothing, but the name of Elder without the thing: in the 9 there is neither the name, nor any note of the ſuppoſed elders; but contrariwiſe diuers reaſons to ſhew the gouernment of the church to haue ben alwayes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the biſhop, and the vnion of the ſame to bee placed in conſent of biſhops, not in ſuppoſed conſiſtories. That <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> knew no elders but miniſters of the word, theſe reaſons do declare: Firſt, for that not onely Deacons which were vnder elders, but Readers alſo did deale in the worde, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted among the cleargie, which was not communicated to men of occupation: Secondly, for that ſuch elders as hee ſpeaketh of, dealt in ſacraments, and in the word: for he<note n="1" place="margin">Lib. 3. cp. 10.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth certaine for adminiſtring the ſacraments to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that had not declared ſufficient ſignes of repentance: Thirdly, for that they had<note n="2" place="margin">Vt ſportulis iiſdem cum presbyteris honorentur. lib. 4. epiſt. 5.</note> wages: fourthly, for that they were not depoſed at pleaſure, nor were temporary: which is a qualitie incident to the newfoundland aldermen.</p>

               <p>To illuſtrate the former Fathers obſcuritie, he bringeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which as he ſuppoſeth ſpeake clearely.

               <p>Of theſe allegations therefore this concluſion may bee drawen out, that in counſels, Fathers, and antiquitie, there is not any argument or coniecture found of all that Diſcipline, which theſe newfangled platformers deſire.</p>
               <p>Nay, there is not any proofe for the ſame in the new wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: onely I except the <hi>Geneuians</hi> and their followers, that haue ſhamefully applyed ſcriptures to their Diſciplinarian dreames. The churches of <hi>Saxony, Wittenberg, Nuremberg, Strausborgh, Ausburg, Frankeforde, Hamborgh,</hi> and other places of <hi>Germany,</hi> (the county <hi>Palatine</hi> except) likewiſe the churches of <hi>Zuricke, Berne, Baſill,</hi> &amp; other true chriſtian churches in <hi>Zuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> &amp; <hi>Denmarke, Sueueland, Pomerany, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> and all the learned men that gouerned thoſe churches, both in their doctrine, and practiſe, are againſt the diſcipline of the new Conſiſtories.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, thoſe that ſpeake for the Conſiſtories, are not all of one opinion. In the ſtate of <hi>Geneua</hi> there is but one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory. there are not many that agree about the proofe, parts, office, or lawes of it. In <hi>Geneua</hi> they doe not allow their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory power to make, or diſanull lawes. In <hi>Fraunce</hi> they giue that power to ſynodes. The conſiſtoriall diſcipline in <hi>France</hi> was at firſt receiued of a fewe, and that not for euidence of Scripture, or proofe, or reaſon, but by ſuffrages of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and Gentry (whereof ſome too well liked the ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine) and by the earneſt labour of <hi>Beza</hi> deſirous to conforme other churches to that of <hi>Geneua,</hi> moſt of the learned miniſters diſſenting from him, and diſallowing his abſurde diſcipline, and not yeelding before the Princes to whome they ſerued, conſtrayned them. What reaſon then hath any to pleade for the conſiſtoriall gouernment which is vnknowen to all antiquite, and repugnant to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18450:29"/>Apoſtolicall practiſe, and the moſt floriſhing Churches in Europe, and was receiued with grudge of learned men, and onely reſteth vpon the conceite of <hi>Caluin, Beza, Daneau,</hi> and ſome halfe ſcore of blind writers, as <hi>Iohn Baptiſta</hi> that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Sneccan,</hi> and <hi>Bertrand de Loques,</hi> and <hi>Oleuian,</hi> and <hi>Robert Stephen,</hi> a better Printer then diuine, and <hi>Perot,</hi> and <hi>de Plurre,</hi> and I knowe not whom, neither of marke nor quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? eſpecially ſeeing ſo many pregnant reaſons are brought againſt the tranſlation of it from the Iewes, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it among Chriſtians, as none haue anſwered, and this libeller thinketh it moſt wiſedome, to paſſe ouer with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>If this be a good argument, that <hi>Daneau, Bertrand de Loques, Baſtingius, Iunius, Piſcator, Oleuian, Caluin, Beza, Sneccan,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſta d'Aureli</hi> thinke ſo: how good will this reaſon be, that all the fathers of all ages haue bene of a contrary iudgement, and diuers godly Martyrs, and learned men in our Church, and other reformed Churches in <hi>Germany, Zuitzerland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> induced with better reaſons, haue thought otherwiſe? Beſides all this, it ſhall appeare that thoſe authors which the libeller alledgeth neuer beleeued, that eyther in time paſt there was a conſiſtorie of partie coluored Aldermen, like to that this libeller deſireth. or that ſuch a one now ought to be placed in euery Church. That <hi>Zuinglius</hi> ſhoul de teach or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Chriſt did inſtitute ſuch Aldermen in his Church, as theſe doe fancie I can no where find.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18450:30"/>yet be found. what ſhould I ſtand long in tracing out the notorious falſehood of this forger of falſe quotations in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paticuler? By theſe already examined you may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how honeſtly hee dealeth in the reſt, and by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that it is knowen, that the Churches of<note n="1" place="margin">Onely in the Palſgraues dition they ſay there is ſome haunt of the elderſhip to be found.</note> 
                  <hi>Germanie, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> and <hi>Zuitzerland,</hi> doe all repell the elderſhip: yea, when certaine factious companions comming from <hi>Geneua,</hi> would haue made ſome ſtirre in the eccleſiaſticall gouernement at <hi>Zuricke,, Gualter</hi> reſiſted them, and the magiſtrates ſent them out of their citie to place their conſiſtories in ſome other quarter, <hi>in remotis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe doth he report vntrueth concerning <hi>M. Nowel, M. Fulke,</hi> and <hi>M. Whytaker. M.

               <p>Neither hath the libeller any reaſon to build his fancies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>M. Fulkes</hi> opinions. for in the confutation of the notes of the Rhemiſh Teſtament, he doth defend the gouernement of the Church of England, as now it is: &amp; albeit he was ſomtime of other mind; yet did he afterward retract his former ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And when <hi>Iohn Field</hi> contrary to his mind did publiſh the pamphlet called the learned diſcourſe, hee was offended with him, and if he had liued, would haue confuted the ſame himſelfe. Neither do I beleeue that <hi>M. Raynolds</hi> being ſo well conuerſant in counſels and fathers, doth admit an elderſhip contrary to the ſayings, and practiſe of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Whitaker</hi> is a man of too great iudgement, to beleeue the vnlettered, &amp; improbable deuiſe of the conſiſtorie: And well is it kowen, that hee hath taught both publikely, and priuately againſt it. Neyther is it likely, that hee hath nowe greater reaſons to moue him, ſince he maried in the tribe of thoſe that fauour theſe conceites then before, ſo that when al is come to all, the authors of this diſcipline are 20, or 30,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18450:31"/>foreine authors, and halfe a ſcore Engliſh perfumed with the ſmoke of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and wel read in <hi>Caluins</hi> Inſtitutions. And the grounds of it are not ſcripture, nor antiquitie, nor reaſon, but conceyte and fooliſh fancie, and the authoritie of ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue no credite ſpeaking in their owne cauſe. If the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler thinke otherwiſe, let him (or elſe becauſe hee is but a man of a weake brayne and ſmall learning) let any of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction drawfoorth <hi>Caluins,</hi> and <hi>Bezaes</hi> reaſons: nay let either <hi>Beza</hi> himſelfe, or any of them anſwere that which hath bene ſet forth againſt their opinions already, and confirme <hi>Caluins</hi> and <hi>Bezaes</hi> weake and euill ſhapen reaſons: and then will the vanitie of all the newe platforme, and alſo of theſe allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appeare.</p>
               <p>To prooue the continuance of the gouernement by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he falſifieth alſo diuers authors, as <hi>Zuinglius, Oecolampadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Capito, Melancthon, Bullinger,</hi> and maketh lyes vpon <hi>Fulke,</hi> and <hi>Reynoldes:</hi> for I thinke maſter <hi>Raynoldes</hi> holdeth no ſuch fancy: And I am aſſured that <hi>Fulke</hi> retracted his opinion, ſo that his onelie reaſon alſo for the continuance of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is becauſe <hi>Miconius</hi> &amp; <hi>Micronius,</hi> and <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> &amp; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau,</hi> and <hi>Calueton, Colladon, Tauergues, Perot, Iacomot, Duple, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lart, Pollan, Perille, Henry,</hi> &amp; others neuer heard of in this horiſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleeue the continuance of the conſiſtorial gouernment, <hi>that we muſt renounce ſcriptures, fathers, and al antiquity:</hi> which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a good, nor learned kind of reaſoning yet for any thing I can ſee, it is not onely the beſt, but alſo the onely reaſon he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. deny the new fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies that they haue deuiſed, &amp; embraced at <hi>Geneua,</hi> you marre the frame of their conſiſtory. why wee ſhould credit them againſt ſcriptures, fathers, ſtories, there can be alledged no cauſe. Much leſſe is there reaſon we ſhould beleeue <hi>Peter Carpenter</hi> a knowen Apoſtata from religion, or <hi>Bodin</hi> a man better conuerſant in pollicy, then in diuinity, and whoſe religion was al poperie. yet if we ſhould, I do not finde any thing in eyther that ſoundeth to the honor of the Aldermens cauſe. For<note n="1" place="margin">Aduerſ. Fr. portum.</note> 
                  <hi>Carpenter.</hi> the matter is euident for he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18450:31"/>moſt bitterly inueigheth againſt them of <hi>Geneua;</hi> and not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doubtful in<note n="1" place="margin">Bodini me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodus hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae. c. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Bodin.</hi> For the wordes alleadged out of <hi>Bodin</hi> his methode of hiſtories concerne the Aldermen nothing; <hi>He ſpeaketh of the cenſure of Biſhops.</hi> and did neuer imagine, nor could conceiue, that the cenſures of the Church were put in the hands of prophane men. <hi>Illa pontificum cenſura</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nihil maius, aut diuinius cogitari potuit.</hi> Secondly, he doeth not commend the men he ſpeaketh of, but the cenſures, for that they were ſo ſtrictly executed. Which commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if magiſtrates were as willing to execute the cenſures of eccleſiaſtical Iudges with vs, as at <hi>Geneua</hi> they are, would no doubt worke like effectes with vs, as with them. And if the magiſtrate ſhould not fauour them, they would doe litle good in any place. Thirdly, he commendeth the ſame cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not as the inſtitution of Chriſt, or as a neceſſarie pollicie for the Church, but as a very good pollitike and ciuill order deuiſed by men, to keepe the common ſort in awe. But what if <hi>Bodin</hi> ſhould ſay ſomewhat of matters he vnderſtoode not, his authoritie is very weake in this caſe, being neither good in diuinitie, nor excellent in pollicie, and neither vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſtate of <hi>Geneua,</hi> nor our countrie: and therefore no fit man to make vs here in England new lawes.</p>
               <p>In the Harmony of Confeſſions, there are certaine wordes inſerted, ſounding much to the commendation of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Neither is it to be marueiled, if they of <hi>Geneua</hi> that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together, made the wordes to ſound as fauourably, as might be for their owne ſtate and gouernement: but that all the churches, or moſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea or any, ſaue the diſciples of the <hi>Geneuian</hi> elderſhip, conſent in one harmony of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of that forme of diſcipline, cannot be proued. No, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the authors with<note n="2" place="margin">See the notes in the latter ende of the harmonie.</note> notorious falſifications, wreſting, and forgerie, drawe the ſentences of the confeſſions fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their purpoſe, to ſpeake for the presbyterial gouernment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vnleſſe the petitioner can iuſtifie this kinde of practiſe, there is not ſo much credit wonne by the vaine names of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18450:32"/>
                  <hi>Carpenter, Bodin,</hi> and the confeſſions of Churches, as there is loſt by forgerie, falſifications, and groſſe leaſings.</p>
               <p>To ſtrengthen the weake ioynts of this diſcraſied reaſon drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authority: he ſaith, Friſt, <hi>that the conſiſtorial gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is alſo receiued of the Churches of Heluetia, the low countries, Millain, Poland, and Hungarie:</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, <hi>that it is vnder the Turke, &amp; among the papiſts:</hi> wherein he ſheweth, either ſinguler ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in lying wilfully, or preſumptuous ignorance in ſpeaking of matters he vnderſtood not. For it is wel knowen, that the churches of <hi>Heluetia</hi> neither haue <hi>Geneuian</hi> elders, nor exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: And that the churches of the lowe countries (to ſpeake nothing of <hi>France</hi> nor <hi>Scotland</hi>) liue in great confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; diſorder: a matter rather to moue vs to refuſe the conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then to embrace it. And likewiſe it is euident, that in <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hungarie,</hi> there is no viſible church, but of thoſe that profeſſe poperie. And albeit there be ſome fewe elders amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the papiſts of <hi>France, Germanie, and Hungarie,</hi> yet doe they not ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, nor haue they any allowance, or thankes for being there. But what maner of concluſion is this: <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe among papiſtes and Turkes Elders are receiued, that we muſt alſo receiue them?</hi> There are alſo <hi>Anabaptiſts, Arrians,</hi> and I know not how many hereſies among the Turkes &amp; papiſtes, which no reaſon requireth vs to embrace. Poperie likewiſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed vnder the Turke: not onely this conſiſtorial diſcipline. So that nothing can be more abſurde then to conclude, <hi>that therefore we are to admitte the Conſistorie, becauſe it is crept in, in Turky, and among the papiſtes.</hi> Likewiſe, it is a vaine bragge, to ſay, <hi>That in the Church of Geneua, Scotland, France, there bee thouſands, and ten thouſands of the best diuines of the worlde.</hi> I would the number of them were greater, and their learning more excellent then it is; I doe not enuie their nombers, nor excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie. but the rewarde of learning taken away, and the great decay that hath hapned of late time in thoſe churches, doeth both teach vs what is now, and what we are to feare; and that when the reckonnig of good diuines is made, it will
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18450:32"/>come farre ſhort of thouſands: much ſhorter of tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. The ignorance &amp; want of miniſters in <hi>France,</hi> &amp; other Conſiſtoriall places is too too lamentable, &amp; ſuch is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this countrie, that one corner of England is able to match them all, eyther in nomber, or qualitie of learned men, albeit we doe not reaſon from our owne authoritie.</p>
               <p>The concluſion therefore that this bedlem diſcourſer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, is too too foppiſh: viz. <hi>that Caluin, and Beza, and Tauerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and Chauueton, and Perot, and I know not who are more likely to finde out the trueth, then the author of the remonstrance, and my ſelfe.</hi> for no man ſtandeth vpon the authoritie of vs two, though the ſimpler of vs in this cauſe, feareth not <hi>T. Cartw.</hi> nor <hi>W. Trau.</hi> no nor <hi>Beza</hi> their patriarke, nor all their brags.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I deſire any man to beleeue me, becauſe I ſay ſo (this is onely the concluſion of the platformers, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the authoritie of men, can ſay nothing for themſelues) But ſeing the interpretations of the conſiſtoriall faction are fond, fantaſtical, ſinguler, and contrary to ſcriptures, to the Iewes hiſtories, to all the fathers, and counſels, yea contrary to all reaſon, &amp; good concluding, &amp; agree badly among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and finally ſtand vpon the fooleries of the <hi>Geneuians</hi> &amp; their ſtupide followers, &amp; vpon their falſhood, forgerie, falſe allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; abuſing of ſcriptures: I do thinke and auow, that neither diuinitie, nor humaine reaſon wil permit any man, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer to be abuſed by them, or to giue credit to thoſe that vſe them. Wherefore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the weake groundes which the conſiſtoriall gouernement ſtandeth vpon, and the forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, falſhood, and impudencie whereby it is ſupported, and the diſorder and confuſion it would worke in the church, in learning, in lawes, in her Maieſties authoritie, in her reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, in euery mans priuate right beſide, if it were receiued: and laſtly the ſeditious, &amp; lewd courſes that ſome men haue taken to eſtabliſh the ſame: If ſome haue bin puniſhed; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that they haue wel deſerued it, yea that they haue deſerued more puniſhment, and leſſe fauour. For
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18450:33"/>neuer was matter preferred with worſe courſe. which I doe not ſpeake, for that I would haue either the diſciplinarians faultes, or penalties aggrauated. (for the faults are grieuous in ough already, and the puniſhment I referre to our ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors:) but leaſt any ſhould ſurmiſe they are wronged, or that the lawes are rigorous, or that the proceedings of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and officers againſt them are iniurious. For further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration whereof, I haue thought good, not onely to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the vaine cauils of the petitioner againſt the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Iudges, and their ſentence pronounced againſt <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> but alſo to maintaine and iuſtifie their vpright and good dealing therein. It may ſeeme ſtrange, that lawe ſhould not haue ſtrength ſufficient to defend it ſelfe againſt the malice of theſe men. But ſeeing the vigour thereof is either dulled, or abated, and men ſuffered to declaime againſt Iudges &amp; lawes; let vs aſſay, whether with reaſon &amp; argument we can defend lawe: A matter albeit hard, where the readers are ſuch, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne againſt lawe, and are led forth without reaſon, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie to be effected, where thoſe that ſhall iudge, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both lawe, and reaſon, vpon confidence therefore of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, diſcrete, and wiſe mens iudgement, I commend this chapter folowing to thy reading.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18450:33"/>and lawes. By theſe I doe ſee, that it ſorteth wel, that men that deſire innouation ſhoulde ſpeake againſt lawes, &amp; that ſuch as doe liue in diſorder, and are voyde of reaſon ſhould ſpeake againſt Iuſtice, &amp; reaſon. <hi>Iohn Vdall,</hi> a man vtterly vnlearned, and very factious was, as you haue heard, condemned vpon the ſtatute of 23 Eliz. 2, And for diuers other diſorders men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the inditement: That it was iuſtly, &amp; equally done, the greatnes of the offence, being faction, and ſedition; the ſincere and vpright dealing of thoſe honorable perſons, that then were Iudges; the allowance of others the moſt reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and learned Iudges in the land, reſoluing on the caſe; the indifferencie of the Iurie; the clemencie of her Maieſties gouernement; the witneſſes, and proofes; the fauour offered to the priſoner; the obſtinacie of the partie, the teſtimonie of all that was preſent, can declare. Againſt all theſe, a certaine <hi>quidam libeller,</hi> lately diſtracted of his wittes, and yet not well recouered, taketh on him to argue boldly, malapertly, yea &amp; very looſely, and fooliſhly. But his malapert, &amp; ſaucie dealing I leaue to gouernours to be conſidered; his looſe and fooliſh diſpute, I doubt not to make manifeſt to all that ſhall reade this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>His firſt exception againſt the ſentence pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Vdal</hi> is, <hi>For that he diffamed not her Maieſtie, which the law prouided for, but Biſhops that are no parte of her Maieſties body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, nor any of the three eſtates of this realme.</hi> wherein he doeth not onely deny thinges true, and affirme things falſe: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo talke of lawe, like a ſtranger ignorant in lawe, and alledge an impertinent, and not concludent matter. That he diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her Maieſtie appeared at the time of his triall by his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and out of his ſeditious ſermons, and ſpeeches proued by diuers witneſſes: and cannot now be called in queſtion, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he that ſpeaketh againſt her Maieſties ſupreme gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, her lawes, her proceedings, and all thoſe eccleſiaſticall officers which rule vnder her, as <hi>Iohn Vdall</hi> and his felowes vſe to doe, diffameth her Maieſtie.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18450:34"/>yea and that much more, then if he ſhould touch her priuate perſon. for that concerneth her gouernement, and therein is ſhe touched eſpecially as a prince, and her princely authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; maieſtie diſgraced. And therefore, ſeeing that is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſe of all the puritane faction: all they that write for their pure gouernement againſt this ſtate, are diffamers of her Maieſties princely dignitie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee denieth the Biſhops to be one of the three eſtates of Parliament, and the Cleargie to be one of the three eſtates of the Realme; contrarie to the reckonning of this Realme, and common ſpeach, and actes of parliament, whoſe common ſtile is the Lordes ſpirituall and temporall, and commons of the realme, contrarie to the vſe of the French, from whence wee had the<note n="1" place="margin">I aſſemblee destroys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats. viz. le elergè, la no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe, &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minautè.</note> worde, and which call the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the aſſemble of the three eſtates: and contrarie to the reckonning of all Chriſtendome, that deuide the realme into the eccleſiaſticall ſtate, nobilitie, &amp; commons; yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Chriſtianitie.

In which kindes of ſpeach, if you make the king a part of the parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, you make the prince to treat with himſelfe, which cannot be.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18450:34"/>ſpiritual &amp; temporal together &amp; make but one ſtate of them, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſpeach. Laſt of all, you make the prince that is head, equal with the partes, and make others as good as him: which is the endeuour of this libeller. and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, that the prince is head of that body that conſiſteth of three eſtates, viz. the lordes ſpirituall &amp; temporal, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curring make lawes to binde the realme nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it true, that the biſhops by law may be excluded out of parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For in al parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ordinarily their aſſent is ſet downe in tearmes. What is done, or what hath bene done in<note n="1" place="margin">Iewel. def. of the Apol.</note> fact, I will not ſay. So the<note n="2" place="margin">Certeine ſtatutes haue bene made by the king, lords ſpirituall, and commons: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the king, lordes ſpirituall and temporall.</note> lordes or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons may alſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but we reaſon of law.

Sometime they departed becauſe they would not be at iudgement of life or member, which they ſuppoſed to be contarie to canons, or becauſe they would not decree contrarie to canons; but that was their wilfulnes. that they were put out, as the libeller holdeth, cannot be proued. Neither <hi>Iewel,</hi> nor <hi>Bilſon,</hi> nor any lawyer will ſay it: wherefore that I haue ſaid, that they are one of the ſtates of parliament, I proue by the general tearmes of ſtatutes, by common ſpeech, by original of the phraſe, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of other nations, by common account of Chriſtians, and the libeller hath ſayd nothing to the contrarie.

               <p>In all this diſcourſe of bodies politike, the libeller talketh neither like politike, lawyer, nor diuine. for ſeeking the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſtate, and ouerthrow of the miniſtery; litle doth he ſeeme to vnderſtand what belongeth to policie: and neither yeelding to her Maieſties prerogatiue, nor wel defining what bodies politike are, nor howe they are made, nor what right they haue: and going about to diſſolue lawes, &amp; call Iudges to render accompt to priuate perſons, and to traduce trials, and iudgements orderly paſſed, can it be ſurmiſed that he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth any one poynt of law, and who wil imagine, that he vnderſtandeth any diuinitie, that ſaith, that biſhops haue onely authoritie from men? for albeit, they bee called exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by men, yet haue they authoritie alſo from<note n="1" place="margin">Matth. 28. &amp; ephe. 4. &amp; rom. 13.</note> God. doth he not vnderſtand, that not only miniſters, but alſo inferiour magiſtrates haue power both from God and men? if he haue not learned ſo much, the Apoſtle wil teach him, that there is no power but of God: and Apoſtolical writings declare that the power of preaching &amp; of adminiſtring the keyes is from God; &amp; that as Biſhops and miniſters haue power, and an externall calling giuen them by men, ſo they haue a warrant alſo for that calling in Gods worde, in which God nowe ſpeaketh to vs; and that theſe two are not contraries to haue a calling from God, and another calling from men. And therefore, where he chargeth vs to ſpeake contraries, he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18450:35"/>is much abuſed. The error was in his owne vnſtayed and blunt head, that could not pearce into this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe there had bene no error in all this diſcourſe: yet is it abſurd, becauſe it is not to purpoſe. for be there two generall bodies in the Realme or more: and be it, that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are part of the politike bodie of her Maieſtie or not: yet if <hi>Iohn Vdall,</hi> and his fellowes haue diffamed her Maieſtie, they are to be puniſhed, and among the reſt this fellow: which had bene greatly to bee wiſhed: for then had hee not wearied the reader with his friuolous diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>That they haue diffamed her Maieſtie, the libeller proueth by way of obiection. wherein though his skill bee litle: yet I graunt the concluſion. neyther can hee with all his ſkill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that little obiection, which himſelfe hath made. what then neede wee vſe many words to ouercome him, that like a frantike diſputer hath wounded himſelfe, and made ſuch an obiection, as he cannot aſſoyle?</p>
               <p>His ſecond exception brought againſt <hi>Vdals</hi> condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, <hi>for that he wrote not aduiſedly.</hi> which if it were as conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as true: I would yeelde he had reaſon. for moſt true it is, that he wrote not aduiſedly. Nay it is a common fault of this faction, that neyther writeth aduiſedly, nor ſoberly. But it is no excuſe for <hi>Vdals</hi> offence. for albeit he wrote not aduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, diſcreetely: yet did he write aduiſedly, that is, of ſet purpoſe, thoſe things that tend to the diſgrace of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties gouernement. Hee wrote alſo maliciouſly, and vttered in his bookes, and ſermons ſeditious matters. And it is not onely his fault, but of diuers other of that ſort. which three points although hee goeth about to cleare, yet doth hee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>but tell vs a long fable of his new diſcipline, enter larded with contumelious ſpeeches, part againſt king H. the</hi> 8, <hi>and William Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus, and part againſt the preſent gouernement,</hi> filling vp the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the factious conſiſtorials iniquitie.</p>

He telleth vs a tale of <hi>Carmichell</hi> of Scotland, <hi>that was compelled to burne his bill, for that hee ſayde in his ſleepe the deuill take away the prieſtes:</hi> which concerneth the matter in queſtion nothing, but that he would haue a glance at the cleargie, whom in diſdaine the factious ſort call prieſtes, when as the name of prieſtes is the beſt title whereby their elders claime their inheritance. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other tale hee telleth in diſgrace of king <hi>H.</hi> the 8, of famous memory: <hi>whome hee chargeth with great iniuſtice for cauſing the execution of</hi> Burder <hi>the Marchant that dwelt at the crowne.</hi> for theſe are a kinde of curres that bite quicke, and dead. A thirde tale hee telleth of <hi>William Rufus, whome hee chargeth with fauouring Iudaiſme, and forcing ſome to rinegue Chriſtianitie:</hi> which is a litle more then can bee proued, and much more then wiſedome required to bee vttered; tending to the ſlander of Chriſtian religion. this preludium made, hee falleth to his matter, and goeth about to prooue, <hi>that he wrote not aduiſedly to diffame her Maieſtie</hi>

                  <hi>that Iohn Vdall and his companions onely ſeeke to haue the corruption of the time redreſſed, and write againſt ignorant, vnlearned, negligent, preſumptuous miniſters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the remnantes of popery and Idolatrie, and agaiuſt enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous corruptions: wherein hee auoweth they haue done nothing, but as the prophetes of olde time did, that exclaymed against dumbe dogges, greedie dogges, and the high places, and as in time of popery ſome did, which inueighed againſt popiſh biſhops: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that they woulde write ſo much againſt their father, if hee were a biſhop, or non reſident:</hi> matters moſt abſurde and falſe. for neyther haue theſe leude and looſe companions ſuch a commiſſion as had the Prophetes, nor is the eccleſiaſticall ſtate to be compared with the idolatrous and wicked prieſts, or popiſh biſhops. Neither haue the ſame followed the ſteps of Prophets, or any propheticall perſons. Gods Prophetes they ſpeake nothing but truth: theſe are ſtill telling vs prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,

They neuer declaymed againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being moſt guilty the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, as theſe fellowes do, which being moſt negligent and looſe in laboring, moſt vnlearned and ignorant, full of newe fooleries, doe notwithſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh againſt others ſo bitterly, that as this wiſe felow profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, they wil not ſpare their father: no nor mother: and why? forſooth becauſe they are <hi>of thoſe which S.

               </p>
               <p>This defence therefore is vnſufficient: firſt, for that it is falſe: for they doe otherwiſe then they profeſſe: And ſecondly, for that they confeſſe in this treatiſe at vnawares, that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame her Maieſties gouernment, <hi>affirming the ſame to be full of enormious corruptions, and to haue in it reliques of Idolatrie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, and to mainteine a wicked and vnſufficient</hi>

               <p>To iuſtifie his companions doings, he telleth vs further, a long diſcourſe, <hi>how they pray for her Maieſty, how they pay ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, how they fought for her Maieſty when the Spanyards were here.</hi> And how ſome <hi>whom England ſhall reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber while it is England, ventured as farre as any.</hi> which is no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the papiſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, nor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iewes &amp; Pagans do: which yeeld al duties to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; fight when as the Puritanes plaied the cowards, &amp; few
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18450:37"/>ſhewed themſelues, for I knowe diuerſe that being there, ſawe very fewe puritanes armed to mainteine this bragge. But ſo deinty and nice they are, that they exclame if they be not highly rewarded for euery litle dutie: yea, for fighting for themſelues &amp; their countrey: and plainely profeſſe, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their deſires for diſcipline, they meane to withdrawe all duetie. And therefore this is but a vaine bragge of praying, preaching foure times a day, and I knowe not what. for their tumultuous praying, and prating in thoſe times did rather diſcourage, then encourage any: and was rather the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of tumult, then any encouragement. and hee that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched foure times a day, had much idle talke, and made many vnſauorie diſcourſes. But ſuppoſe ſome fewe of theſe men ſhewed themſelues loyall, and were ſo ventrous as to come to Tilberie, or rayle againſt the Spanyardes; yet others, as it may well be ſurmiſed, were framing ſupplications, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding horſe and armes, to come to preſent them al in armes. Then did <hi>Martin</hi> frame his ſeditious libelles; then others preached ſeditious ſermons, all tending to the weakning of thoſe that willingly offred themſelues in that ſeruice. And <hi>Martin ſenior</hi> profeſſeth that when the enemie was readie to aſſayle vs abroad, there were a hundred thouſand handes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſubſcribe the ſupplication of puritanes at home: which ſaith he, <hi>in good pollicie, (we being in feare of outward force) might not bee denied, nor diſcouraged.</hi> Then which there can bee no greater argument of their diſloyall proceedings.</p>
               <p>Where they are charged with rayling againſt the princes gouernement, they excuſe it ſaying, <hi>that therein they meant no more malice to her Maieſtie, then the godly prophets, that vnder E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah and Ioſiah reprooued the abuſes of the Church.</hi> which is a point, which muſt bee read with great patience. for who can elſe endure to heare them compare themſelues to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, their doings to the doing of the prophets, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon being ſo vnlike? Gods prophets were humble, meeke, peaceable, and poſſeſſed with Gods ſpirit. Theſe are proude,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18450:37"/>diſdainefull, contentious, and driuen with other ſpirits. They neuer ſpake againſt the ſtate, nor condemned the calling of prieſts, nor ſaid that the lawes were antichriſtian and diueliſh: theſe ſtand eſpecially on theſe points, &amp; abuſe the gouernors, and rayle againſt lawes, and this fellowe as malepertly, as the beſt.</p>
               <p>He would further make the worlde beleeue, <hi>that his clyents ſeeke onely for reformation, and doeth euery where dubbe them with names of ſeekers of reformation.</hi> But great difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt pretence and performance. <hi>Iacke Strawe</hi> and <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> and <hi>Kett</hi> of <hi>Norffolke,</hi> and all rebels pretend reformation as well as theſe, but the courſes, and deedes of both tend to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diſorder, &amp; confuſion. the prince they would abaſe, the Church they would ſpoyle, the eccleſiaſticall ſtate they ſeeke to aboliſh: learning and rewardes in all places where they come, they take away. Moreouer hee goein about to prooue, <hi>that biſhops may be hated for their doctrine:</hi> and firſt, for <hi>that they impugne that, which heretofore they haue taught.</hi> but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lequent good, nor antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t true. for albeit that biſhop <hi>Elmar</hi> ſpake ſometimes againſt the exceſſe of biſhops liuings, as he then imagined, not knowing in what ſtate they ſtood, yet did he neuer condemne the degree and dignitie of biſhops. nor did biſhop <hi>Bollingham,</hi> as it ſhould ſeeme ſpeake againſt the manners of others then papiſticall biſhops: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly againſt the degree of biſhops he neuer ſpake. Neither are the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of one or two, to be aſcribed to all: but if they which ſpeake contrary to themſelues, deſerue hatred, what doeth <hi>Tho. Cartw.</hi> deſerue, that in many things ſpeaketh hee knoweth not what, in ſome things contrary to himſelſelfe, <hi>as in election of miniſters, power of the presbytery, and diuers poynts?</hi> And what doth the Libeller deſerue that confeſſeth hee tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he knoweth not what, contrarying his whole diſcourſe?</p>
               <p>Another reaſon hee bringeth to prooue that biſhops may iuſtly be hated, and <hi>that is becauſe they confeſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>infinite abuſes to be in the church.</hi> But the ground of the reaſon is falſe:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18450:38"/>for no biſhop did euer confeſſe ſo much. nor doth it follow, becauſe ſome one ſpeaketh vntrueth, that all the cleargie of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be maligned, and hated.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he thinketh them worthy of hate, <hi>for that hauing taught that a biſhop &amp; prieſt is all one by Gods word: they now teach; that all that holde ſo, be hereticks.</hi> But he doth vs wrong for char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vs to ſay, that a biſhop, &amp; prieſt is all one by Gods word: the word <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> &amp; <hi>presbyter</hi> in ſcriptures is commonly vſed for one: but we ſpeake engliſh, &amp; call thoſe that rule biſhops, and others prieſts: which diſtinction we find plainly in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and therefore holde the teachers of equality to be Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, &amp; confounders of gouernment, &amp; to be iuſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not only by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> yea &amp; by the conſent of all the fathers, that diſtinguiſh prieſts into 2 ſorts, giuing the name of biſhop to thoſe that rule, and prieſt to the ſecond that are ruled. And therefore moſt ſenceleſſe is their reaſon, <hi>that becauſe they haue all one name, will conclude of it aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of all miniſters.</hi> For <hi>magiſtrates,</hi> teachers, ſubiectes haue all one name, and yet are diuided into diuers degrees. In vaine therfore doth the libeller bring proofes that the words <hi>presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> &amp; <hi>epiſcopus</hi> are commonly taken for one, for that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding there may be difference of degrees. howſoeuer they wil anſwere this obiection: yet is it apparant, that the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth, as I ſaid, their conſiſtorial aldermen. Away the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the new church aldermen, &amp; thoſe heretikes that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine them: for albeit <hi>Epiphanius erred in accompting them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes that prayed not for the dead,</hi> yet is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame no reaſon to ſhew he erred in this, which not only <hi>Auguſtine</hi> mainteineth, but all the Fathers alſo. &amp; not only they; but the foure general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which this land approueth: ſo that by the lawes of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> they are heretiks, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hold the equality of miniſters. what ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les dealing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was this, for the libeller to alledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

And therefore as long as theſe fellowes interprete againſt all ſcripture, antiquitie, and reaſon; yea and themſelues too: it skilleth not what they ſay againſt ſuperiour degrees: Againſt which <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Melancthon, Caluin, Bullinger</hi> and the reſt are moſt peruerſely alledged.

               <p>The Libeller would alſo haue the eccleſiaſticall ſtate <hi>made odious for their miſgouernment:</hi> a very malitious and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent courſe. for ſuppoſe that 3, or 4 ſhould doe againſt lawe, is it reaſon that law ſhould be taken away? or that many ſhould ſuffer for a few mens faults? how much more vnreaſonable is it, that the ſame ſhould bee oppreſſed, for ſuppoſed miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment? That articles are miniſtred to parties conuented in law, and ſubſcription required to lawes, is moſt conſonant to lawes: neither is any thing in the lawes of England, or the ſtatute 25. <hi>Henr.</hi> 8.19. there to the contrary. The Libeller ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to vnderſtand himſelfe nor others, when hee tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of biſhops deuiſing articles, and ſubſcriptions, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them in their owne names: for there can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed a more abſurde kinde of ſpeach. Subſcriptions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of others, and not publiſhed; and articles are obiected as priuate meanes to bolt out trueth, &amp; not as lawes to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. A courſe vſuall in all courts of chancery, eſchecker, &amp; ſtarrechamber: but what reaſon had this fellowe to obiect to biſhops that which they doe not, when <hi>Th. Cartw. and his</hi>

               <p>They ſay, that <hi>biſhops appoynting ſpeciall prayers vpon occaſion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18450:40"/>of the inuaſion of the Spaniards, and other ſpeciall cauſes, doe contrary to that which they require in others: but they miſtake.</hi> for thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not, that in euery point of the Communion booke ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue not ſtrict order, which the booke in ſome caſe aloweth: but ſuch malitious felowes, as of malitiouſnes refuſe it, and contemptuouſly oppugne it. Neither is the vſe of ſpeciall prayers vpon occaſion, contrary to the vſe of the booke of common prayer ſubſcribed vnto with excluſion of all other orders of common prayers: for both may ſtand together. Neither did Byſhops any thing in this behalfe without her Maieſties ſpeciall commandement: But theſe fellowes are of thoſe, that allow not her Maieſties godly orders, nor any thing done by Gouernors nor any prayers but fond, looſe, vaine, and abſurd babbling oraiſons of Puritans: and ſeeme to be ſory, that any ſhould pray againſt the Spaniards.</p>
               <p>They thinke alſo, and the Libeller affirmeth, that <hi>it is as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for contentious perſons to refuſe the ſurples, as for Byſhops not to vſe pastorall ſtaues.</hi> But it is moſt abſurde ſo to ſay, the vſe of the ſurples being conſirmed by law, the vſe of the paſtorall ſtaues not being required by lawe, or cuſtome: But were paſtorall ſtaues enioyned by lawe, is this a good reaſon, becauſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops offend, that euery lawleſſe compagnion ſhould paſſe without controlment?</p>
               <p>That <hi>Cawdry</hi> was puniſhed by order of lawe is apparant for that the ſtatute doeth authorize the high Commiſſioners to proceede according to their Commiſſion. If any fault were therein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, it was that he was vſed with ſo<note n="1" place="margin">His cauſe was almoſt two yeeres in handling, his conformitie continually being exſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> much lenitie: Neuer was any more obſtinate, nor could any man haue more fauor eſpecially without deſert. for neither had he learning, nor other good qualitie, nor was any more factious.</p>
               <p>That <hi>felonies were examined before the high Commiſsioners Ec-Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> is a vaine cauill. neither doeth it follow, becauſe vpon examinations of matters, fellonious libels are found out, that they proceede to the cognition and determining of felonies. Neither do the Eccleſiaſtical Iudges contray to law
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18450:40"/>either in citations, or miniſtring othes in cauſes <hi>ex officio,</hi> or puniſhing lewde &amp; factious perturbers of the ſtate.

Otherwiſe all men may ſee he goeth about rather to calumniate good men: then to iuſtifie any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt his aduerſaries. If he prooue nothing, let him be aſhamed to <hi>cal his factious compagnions ſeekers of reformation: their libels and friuolous pamphlets, bookes of reformation:</hi> and ceaſe to impugne her Maieſties lawes, &amp; ſentence of Iudges againſt <hi>Iohn Vdall,</hi> whoſe fact no man can defend, but ſuch as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſedition, &amp; faction: nor praiſe, but ſuch as are enamored of ſenceles &amp; vnlearned hypocrites: &amp; let him ceaſe to charge the Biſhops with ſeeking his life. for they are not his parties: nay next to her Maieſtie he is to thanke ſome Biſhops for his life. for if they had bin as he ſaith, nay, if ſome had not entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him, percaſe he had bin hanged, &amp; all this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie taken vp and ended. If he ceaſe not, percaſe the world will thinke that <hi>Vdall</hi> deſerued rather more ſeueritie, then is now ſhewed to him: and that the libellers bolde demeanour may procure him to haue iuſtice for his fooliſh prating, rather then fauour for any wittie reaſoning.</p>
               <p>Hitherto all the Libellers diſpute is without ſequele. for <hi>admit ſome one or more ſhoulde teache falſely, or doe againſt lawe:</hi> yet is it no reaſon, that euery baſe compagnion ſhould with open mouth rayle againſt her Maieſties gouernement and Lawes, and call them Antichriſtian, and ſpeake againſt the whole cleargie, yea againſt Iudges, and all that fauour the preſent gouernment. Let thoſe that haue taught falſely be refuted, and thoſe that haue done leudly bee puniſhed. That the ſtate ſhould be diſſolued for the miſgouernment of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, no reaſon will admit.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>platformers offer their liues to prooue their diſcipline,</hi> (which the libeller alledgeth to excuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) is a ſenceleſſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. for no traytors, nor felo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s deale in any cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,

And ſo ſimple is their proofe, that if they bee wiſe, they will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any thing vpon it: for the demonſtrations of diſcipline ſtande confuted without replye, and all their presbyteriall imaginations reſt beaten without anſwere: neyther is any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in all T.

               <p>To excuſe his fellowes ſilence, the Libeller pretendeth want of libertie, &amp; Printers; which cannot iuſtly be alledged: for how can they want printers, hauing <hi>Waldgraue</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and others at <hi>Geneua, Middleburg</hi> &amp; <hi>Leyden</hi> at commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſide their priuate preſſes? Or how can they pretend want of liberty, ſeeing none haue bene long impriſoned, and many came neuer in priſon? That which the libeller here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth againe of other churches, <hi>whome hee would haue vs to conforme our ſelues vnto,</hi> he would neuer haue mentioned, if he had vnderſtood the grounds of his owne diſcipline. for them ſelues ſay, <hi>that all</hi>

                  <hi>Churches be aequall,</hi> and it is apparant that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery chriſtian realme and Church is to be gouerned by her owne lawes: but theſe bee the fellowes that would tranſlate the Popedome to <hi>Geneua,</hi> and haue vs fetch lawes from new <hi>Rome.</hi> Seeing then that <hi>Iohn Vdall</hi> and his compagnions haue mainteined a lewde and fond gouernment neuer heard of in antiquitie, and by wicked forgery and lyes haue gone about to diſgrace the preſent ſtate and the gouernours, and haue rayled againſt her Maieſtie and lawes; and that the Libellers defence is moſt friuolous, it can not bee denyed, that they haue written maliciouſly to diffame her Maieſtie:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18450:41"/>And good is were, they had ſtayed in writing: but they would not be ruled. for <hi>T. Cartw. Ioh. Vdall,</hi> and others were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, but too well with <hi>Hackets</hi> conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>His third exception againſt <hi>Iohn Vdals</hi> condemnation, <hi>is for that he wrote not againſt her Maieſties</hi> perſon. But the ſame is very friuolous, for the Maieſtie of a prince conſiſteth in his power, lawes, gouernement, and not in his particuler perſon, or priuate qualities or behauiour. Neither are the papiſts pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for ſpeaking againſt her perſon, but ſpeaking againſt her ſupremacie and lawes. Therefore ſeeing hee confeſſeth <hi>he wrote againſt her lawes and gouernement, hee muſt alſo confeſse,</hi> that hee offended againſt the ſtatute that made it felonie to write malitious, &amp; diffamatory matters againſt her Maieſty. The preamble declareth as much, for that the ſame prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, <hi>that certain perſons euil affected to her Maieſty ſhould be ſuppreſsed:</hi> In which number theſe that would diſanul her gouernment, and would bring her in ſubiection to <hi>Hackets</hi> prophets, or the prophetical conſiſtory are eſpecially to be reckoned, &amp; it was the ſpecial meaning of the parliament that the malepartneſſe both of papiſts, &amp; puritans ſhould be repreſſed: as ſome there preſent in parliament do witneſſe. Neither is it material, <hi>that penal lawes are of ſtrict interpretation,</hi> for expound it as ſtrict as you wil. it cannot bee, but thoſe that diffame her Maieſty any way, either in perſon or gouernment muſt fal within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the ſtatute. That which is brought of the ſtatute of <hi>13. Eliz. c. 1.</hi> and <hi>1.</hi> &amp; <hi>2.</hi> of <hi>Mary. 3.</hi> is idle talke, and concludeth nothing. neither is it true, that thoſe that account her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties religion, &amp; lawes heretical, and ſchiſmatical are without the compaſſe of the ſtatute, that maketh it treaſon to call her <hi>Maieſty ſchiſmatike, &amp; heretike.</hi> fond likewiſe it is, <hi>that he talketh of ſtealing of horſes,</hi> and contrary to his purpoſe: Seeing hee mainteineth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of aſſes, that would encroch vpon her Maieſties gouernment, &amp; ſteale away thé hearts of her people.</p>
               <p>But ſaith he, <hi>her Maieſtie is a body politike in fiction.</hi> which is vntrue, for ſhee is in trueth a politike bodie: That is hath a

That in king <hi>Henry,</hi> and king <hi>Edwardes</hi> dayes order was taken, for the collection together of lawes in vſe, is granted: but that they meant to correct lawes in vſe, which this libeller doeth inſinuate, or did confeſſe, <hi>that there be infinite corruptions in eccleſiaſticall lawes, which he affirmeth,</hi> cannot be proued. I will not longer ſtand vpon this point, for that I haue ſpoken of it already, and the ſame is beſide the libellers purpoſe; which ſhould proue that <hi>Vdall</hi> and his conſortes offend not againſt the ſtatute of Eliz. 23. aboue mentioned. But his reaſons are all too weake. for eyther ſtand they vpon falſe groundes, or elſe are they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen, and euil featured.</p>
               <p>That which he ſaith of <hi>Wickleffe, Suinderby, Tindall, Hooper, Barnes, Latimer,</hi> and others whom he chargeth with ſpeaking againſt the ſtate of the Church, and common wealth, is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vntrue. let the places be ſhewed, and their wordes ſet downe. For in theſe that already are brought forth, there is no ſuch matter conteined: they doe not call our lawes anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, nor diſgrace the gouernement of the prince, nor condemne the ſuperioritie of biſhops: nor raile at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel, and gouernors of Chriſtes church. they neuer framed libels nor inuectiues againſt the ſtate. nor euer ſought to haue a new found gouernement eſtabliſhed in the church. and albeit they inueigh againſt the manners of men, and corruptions of thoſe times, yet ſhall you not finde any, that hath written in <hi>Martins</hi> ſatyrical and doogeon ſtile: nor that ſought to haue either Church or ſtate turned vpſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe, or committed to the direction of the common ſorte. compare them with theſe late rimers, libellers, and firebrands of ſedition: you ſhall ſee a wonderfull difference.</p>
               <p>Further ſaith he, ſome finde fault with the forfeiture of traytors landes, ſome with the ſhort returne of writs, others with pluralities of fermes, and engroſſing of Mannors, others with racking of rents, and diuers other lawes and cuſtomes. admit they did: yet is not the fact of one, an excuſe for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18450:44"/>of others. we liue by lawes, not by examples. But it cannot be ſhewed, that any euer ſo raged with malice againſt lawes as the Martiniſts did, and doe. thoſe percaſe ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome one or two lawes, and that modeſtly ſubmitting themſelues to the controlement of their ſuperiors: they rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not againſt gouernors, nor lanced them with malicious libels, nor ſought innouation, but redreſſe of things diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. to all theſe examples therefore of <hi>Wickleffe, Suinderby, Hooper, Barnes, Latimer,</hi> and thoſe that haue found fault with ſome abuſes in lawe; I anſwere firſt, that it is one thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the reformation of ſome one abuſe, and another to deſire the ſubuerſion both of all eccleſiaſtical gouernors, and lawes, which cannot be without a dangerous innouation of ſtate; &amp; ſecondly, that the courſe of the proceeding of thoſe that haue ſpoken againſt mens manners, and ſome one lawe, is farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from theſe mens doings and writings, that ſtriue for the new kingdome of the Conſiſtorie: laſtly that <hi>Wickleffe, Suinderby, Tyndal, Barnes, Hooper, Latimer,</hi> ſpake againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of papiſticall Biſhops, both in doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: yet neuer did they ſeeke for a new conſiſtorial gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor did they libell againſt the gouernors, the lawes, the ſtate.</p>
               <p>This is but the Conſiſtorian ſtile lately founde out, and practiſed by lewde lozels, and ſatyricall backebiters of good men. for which, if no other puniſhment be laid on them, yet they ſhall ſurely anſwere at the laſt dreadfull day, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amend not.</p>
               <p>Further it is a ſhamefull courſe, though greatly pleaſing theſe mens humors, to take that which good men ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt pompous and tyrannicall Biſhops that gouerned at pleaſure, and gaue ouer preaching altogether: and to apply the ſame againſt Piſhops, that neither ſo excell in wealth, but that many baſe ſcriuanos, and marchants, yea ſhoemakers and taylors ſurpaſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; nor in power, but that meane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions abuſe them; &amp; are not popiſh tyrants, but preachers
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18450:44"/>of the goſpell. If the libeller had had any modeſtie, he would not thus haue abuſed mens writings: nor if he had intended any other matter, then to make libels, would he haue drawne out certaine rimes out of <hi>Pierce Plowma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaucer,</hi> men farre excelling him in all modeſtie and humanitie. for albeit they rimed againſt wicked biſhops, yet doe they ſpeake more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly of them, then he doth of godly and learned men, whome with rime dogrell, and dogged railing, and many ſlaunderous reportes, and that in the preſence of a prince, he goeth about malitiouſly to diſgrace. Not that he would teach them any good: <hi>For he ſendeth them to the diuill to learne. Learne ſaith he of the deuill:</hi> of which Maiſter, the libeller hath learned all his rayling, and ſhamefull ſlaundering; and from him hath he borrowed all his malice. Therefore I ſay not as he ſaith, <hi>learne of the deuill;</hi> but learne not of him: he is a raylour, and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derour, and ſo are all libellers, and reuellers, the right diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Sathan.</p>
               <p>That theſe bookes paſſe with this approbation, <hi>Seene and allowed,</hi> it followeth not, that all thinges therein conteined are allowed: but that they are allowed to be printed, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing in the opinion of him that allowed them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſtate. and rather, becauſe we ſhould reape ſome profite by that which is good; then looſe the good for the bad: or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow that is euil becauſe it is ioyned with that which is good.</p>
               <p>Neither are the conſiſtoriall libellers puniſhed, for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt ciuill offices in biſhops, or faultes in them, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it be an vnciuill parte to diſgrace honeſt men in rimes and rayling diſcourſes, and ſermons, and to reprehend with ſuch vehemencie that, which they cannot diſproue: but becauſe they bring in many pernitious doctrines, and ouerturne all gouernement, and deface the princes regiment, and bring in infinite lewd nouelties, and that by rayling, reuelling, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And therefore, if any ſuffer any puniſhment, it is not for ſeeking reformation, but for deforming and diffaming, the frame of this Church gouernment, and common wealth,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18450:45"/>and that in ſhamefull ſorte. Neither doeth this libeller deſire any thing more, then that learned men ſhould bee ſet aſide, that ſuch ſorrie hines as himſelfe might enter in place: A man fitter to be ſcourged in Bedlem, then placed in Church gouernement.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any ſhelter for the libellers cauſe, vnder the names of my Lord of Canterburie, Maiſter <hi>Nowel,</hi> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Rainoldes,</hi> &amp; M. <hi>Bancroft:</hi> their opinions &amp; manners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo contrarie, ſame was M, <hi>Bancroft</hi> from calling her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie a pope, <hi>He reprehendeth Martin, for his raſh aſſertion, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe is a pope.</hi> All theſe men defend; the other oppugne the ſtate: the one by good meanes ſeeke diſorders to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the other by all iniurious and vnlawfull meanes, yea at length by conſpiracie, ſought to ouerturne the ſtate. And therefore, as the one deſerueth praiſe, ſo the libellers clyents deſerue puniſhment. And nought it is that hee can ſay for them, their fault is ſo foule, and his wit ſo ſimple.</p>
               <p>They doe I ſay, deſerue puniſhment: firſt, for diffaming her Maieſtie, and next, for plotting and working of rebellion. And that is gathered by their doctrine, which doeth clearely ſhewe their meaning. for how ſhould a man gather a mans meaning, but by his wordes? Liſten then firſt, what good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſaith a patriarke of this ſeditious congregation. <hi>All men</hi> (<note n="1" place="margin">p. 73.74.77.</note> ſaith he) <hi>Counſellors, noblemen, inferior Magiſtrates, and people are bound, and charged to ſee the lawes of God kept, and to ſuppreſſe, and reſiſt idolatrie by force.</hi> Againe: <hi>If the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the proceedings of the Conſiſtorials, both in Scotland and England declare the ſame. In Scotland the roades firſt of Ruthuen, then of Sterling, where forcing the king, for ſafegarde of his honor and life, to take himſelfe to the Caſtle; they depoſed Biſhops, and erected Conſiſtories. In England they ſent about their factors into euery ſhire to procure ſubſcriptions to their newfangled diſcipline, they ſet vp Conſiſtories and Synodes, and watched the time of the Spaniſh inuaſion, to beginne their faites; and but that they ſawe themſelues two weake, would haue by force (as many reaſons make vs ſuſpect) executed their purpoſe. yea notwithſtanding their weakenes, <hi>Hacket, Coppinger,</hi> and <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginton,</hi> with whome <hi>Th. Cartwright</hi> did communicate by diuers letters, went about to raiſe a tumult, and to ſet vp their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18450:46"/>diſcipline, which they called their newe kingdome. for which their new king was hanged, drawen, and quartered, and <hi>Coppinger</hi> according to the puritan ſtile, made away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> theſe men haue many markes of faction in their doings; their nightly meetings, ſecrete whiſperings, open inuectiues againſt lawes, and gouernours, glorious pretenſes of reformation, mutuall intelligence, newe names, ſecrete confederacies, ſubſcriptions, and ſuch like, doe marke them out for mutinous, and rebellious compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the precedents of the Anabaptiſts, doe teach vs what an vnbrideled thing the people is, where they take the ſword to worke reformation with: And that if the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts which condemne warres, went about by force to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their hereſies, that much more theſe factious mates, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of diuers ſortes of heretikes and ſchiſmatikes, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious perſons, putting ſuch glory in armes, would aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue made a great ſtirre, if they had not bene repreſſed.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> their threatning wordes, which God would not ſuffer them to conceale, did bewray their wicked purpoſes. <hi>Martin threatneth force againſt thoſe that maintaine the ſtate.</hi> The author of the demonſtration <hi>denounceth great troubles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, if they may not haue their will;</hi> and ſayeth, <hi>That the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline ſhall come in by a way, that ſhall make all our heartes to ake.</hi> And another of <hi>Martins</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">Mart. ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And therefore, ſeeing both by their doctrine, and wordes, and deedes they doe declare themſelues, and their meaning; In vaine doeth this lunatike ſcribe babble, <hi>that they entend no rebellion.</hi> What ſhould I beleeue wordes, when wee may ſee deedes to the contrarie? yea, factes openly maintained in writing.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto the drift of <hi>T. Cartwrights,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
                  <hi>Penries, Martins</hi> bookes, to moue a diſlike in mens mindes of the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18450:46"/>and nothing will appeare more notorious then the bad meaning of theſe mutinous libellers.</p>
               <p>But ſaith the libeller, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>Whereas the aduerſaries doe take as a principle: that whoſoeuer writeth to worke a diſcontentment in the mindes of the ſubiects doe entend rebellion, that is a moſt vntrue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and ſophiſticall paralogiſme.</hi> ſo little doeth hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, either what is vntrueth, or what is a paralogiſme. for the trueth of the aſſertion, I haue alreadie clearely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: and well doeth it appeare, that hee vnderſtood not his Logike termes,<note place="margin">Ariſt. elench. 1.</note> that maketh one propoſition a paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme. for a paralogiſme is a ſophiſticall ſyllogiſme, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of diuers propoſitions. but this aſſertion is neither ſyllogiſme, nor ſophiſticall aſſertion, conteining a very plaine trueth, which nowe themſelues haue iuſtified by their actions, and alwayes politikes haue taken it as an vndoubted trueth. for no man writeth to moue mens mindes to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment with the preſent gouernement, but hatcheth in his owne minde the ſeedes of rebellion. Firſt, the papiſtes wrote diuers ſeditious pamphlets againſt religion, and the ſtate: afterwarde, they put on armes and rebelled. So firſt came forth <hi>Martin</hi> and diuers pamphlets of like argument, afterwarde roſe vp king <hi>Hacket</hi> the great emperour of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinarian faction, and his prophets. the onely fault was, that their patriarkes were not readie to followe them, or could not followe them, for the multitude of boyes that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and gazed vpon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he ſaith: <hi>they write in an humble, loyall, and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſort.</hi> Of which let <hi>Cartwrightes, Martins,</hi> &amp; <hi>Penries</hi> bookes beare witnes. for pride and ſpite, and diſloyaltie, I neuer read bookes that matched them.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>Hee would defend his clyents with the example of Chriſt, that diſcouered many abuſes, and Peter that ſtroke off Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus his eare a ſeruant, or purſiuant</hi> (as hee ſaith) <hi>of the high prieſtes.</hi> Percaſe hee would haue his compagnions to cut off the purſiuants and the Queenes meſſengers eares, yea
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18450:47"/>and head too, if they could. So little can he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine himſelfe, that in the defence of force and rebellion, hee doeth nothing but breathe force and rebellion; And is ſtill talking of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and cutting. But the caſe is vnlike. for Chriſt neuer ſpake againſt the lawes; theſe ſay that we haue an antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian gouernement. Chriſt condemneth not the office of prieſtes: theſe condeme the office of Biſhops, and the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall ſtate. Chriſt ſought not to erect any new Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, or gouernement in diſpite of gouernours; theſe doe nothing elſe. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtrake off <hi>Malchus</hi> eare, which Chriſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: theſe would cut mens throates for to haue their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, and ſo leaue them. In fine, theſe neither are like Chriſt, nor <hi>Peter,</hi> nor good Chriſtians: but raile, reuell, conſpire, and raiſe mutinies. They doe not ſpeake to the gouernours, where they may haue redreſſe of diſorders: but mutter in the eares of the people, as if they meant to renew a new maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, or make the<note n="1" place="margin">Veſpres Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliennes. Mach. Hiſtor.

And as thoſe that ſpeake againſt the lawes, and ciuil gouernment in euery place before the people, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not auoide the name of rebels, albeit the ſame be afterwarde motioned in parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: no more can theſe excuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of diſloyaltie in all places declaiming againſt the preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. albeit they woulde haue the ſame altered by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>Further, hee ſaith, <hi>that if they pretended rebellion, then they would riſe vp and reforme things themſelues, rather then write bookes to that purpoſe.</hi> As if it were not madneſſe to riſe before they had prepared the peoples mindes to rebellion. Nay firſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18450:47"/>a ſide muſt be made, and then matters muſt bee executed. So that it appeareth that his complices did take the direct way to rebellion, and that this courſe could not bee taken before that men were moued to diſcontentment by villeinous bookes, like thoſe of <hi>Martin,</hi> and his whelpes.</p>

That they <hi>intended the deliuerie of certaine factious perſons committed to priſon, and to erect the presbyteries, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſse the gouernours and lawes, their letters, examinations, and writings doe declare.</hi> And yet forſooth this ignorant fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe holdeth, thar they neuer went about to mooue any ſtirre, or rebellion: percaſe hee thought theſe matters had not bene knowen.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly he obiecteth further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
                  <hi>that if his clientes intende rebellion, then the lawes alſo, and biſhops doe intende rebellion: for that they expect likewiſe further reformation.</hi> But the caſe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: Good men deſire reformation of manners by executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good lawes, and ſupplie of imperfections: They ſtand for the ſtate, they withſtand all innouations, they proceede orderly. Theſe fellowes contrariwiſe ſeeke the ouerthrowe of infinite lawes, of infinite officers: and that by reuelling and diſorder: they ſeeke the eſtabliſhment of an vncouth and vnknowen gouernement by faction and conſpiracie,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18450:48"/>odious to all ſtates, and good men. Neyther can hee ſhroud his clyents vnder maſter <hi>Nowels</hi> authoritie. for they want much of his learning and honeſtie, and farre diuerſe is that elderſhip, hee meaneth, from this packe of elders, that they deſire.</p>
               <p>Neither becauſe printers ſell popiſh bookes, by which ſome are mooued to diſcontentment, doth it follow that therefore it is lawful to mooue diſcontentment. for neyther may they ſell them but to men knowen and licenced without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: nor are all popiſh bookes of one ſort. As for Doctor <hi>Percy</hi> I thinke he doth not ſet foorth newe lawes, nor newe common wealthes, but for eaſe and introduction of ſtudents doth gather a ſumme of all lawes in force. but the libellers furious mates would burne them and vtterly ouerthrow law, that we might depend vpon the variable oracles of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, which he ſeeketh to erect.</p>
               <p>Eightly hee addeth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                  <hi>that many doe maintaine papiſtes and traitors, and yet doe not mooue diſcontentment,</hi> vnto which I am content that hee maketh his clyentes like. for I doe not knowe any in England that hath procured the diſcharge of more recuſants (and that not gratis) or more holpen them, then certaine capitall and principall puritanes. The libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler knoweth whome I meane. The exception is friuolous and falſe for neyther are they to bee allowed that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne papiſtes, nor puritanes: or that procure their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. Nor may we thinke, but that they that maintaine them, meane no good to the ſtate: and therefore let the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dunſe aduiſe hereafter what hee ſayeth, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace his beſt friendes, nor lye to no purpoſe, nor bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of his cauſe. And finally let him not ſay, <hi>our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes are nought,</hi> vnleſſe hee reply better, hitherto hee hath ſweate and ſayde nothing; yea and when hee hath ſweate out all his wit, yet can he not anſwere any one title of our reaſons. The reaſon that hee ſetteth downe is his owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and is ſenceles in deed, and proceedeth from a man voyd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18450:49"/>of wiſedome, learning and honeſtie, But the ſame ſet downe in good tearmes will make him in deede aſhamed, but not as he ſaith to anſwere it, but becauſe hee cannot anſwere it. No, <hi>though he profeſſe to ſpeake for the innocent.</hi> He ſhould haue ſayd, <hi>in the cauſe of the dumbe,</hi> for ſo are the wordes of <hi>T. C.</hi> his maſters text. But his clyentes they haue ſpoken too much, and wiſh themſelues, they had bene dumbe. Now albeit they be not mute, <hi>yet he taketh them to be innocent, and that in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> Is not this a worthy fellow thinke you, that oppoſeth his fond and looſe opinion againſt the euidence of witneſſes, verdict of the iurie, ſentence of the iudge? But what ſhoulde we looke for other at theſe mens handes, whoſe braue conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, and all their learning ſtandeth on 3 or 4 mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But let vs heare what he bringeth to anſwere our obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and for diſcharge of his clyentes that ſtand at the barre.</p>
               <p>He ſayth, <hi>that Martin where he threatneth, that Doctor</hi> Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <hi>ſhall haue xx fiſtes about his eares, meaneth that many ſhall write againſt him:</hi> A goodly comment: As if puritanes wrote with fiſts, rather then fingers: which may very well bee; for their writing is ſeditious, rude and vnciuill. To prooue that <hi>Martin</hi> meaneth ſo, <hi>he alledgeth first, that</hi> Martin <hi>is no Atheiſt nor papiſt.</hi> But there is great doubt of papiſme, and flat proofe of atheiſme. for who ſcoffeth at religion but Atheiſts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth ſcriptures in ſcorne, but ſuch as beleeue no God? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he ſaith, <hi>xx is too few to make a rebellion.</hi> But the patch might vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that one is inough to begin a mutinie: And that if D. <hi>Bridges</hi> ſhall haue xx fiſtes againſt him, their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, <hi>that others ſhall haue many more about them.</hi> for I thinke their quarrell is not onely againſt D. <hi>Bridges.</hi> In the ende the libeller ſeeing his cauſe deſperate, <hi>ſaith that hanging is too good for</hi> Martin. which I yeelde vnto, and aſſigne the libeller for his paynes, to be the executioner. And thus the noble <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, viz. I. Penry, I. Vd. I. F.</hi> all <hi>Iohns,</hi> and <hi>I. Thr.</hi> that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in making of <hi>Martin,</hi> muſt by ſentence of the libeller,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18450:49"/>if they had any euill purpoſe, goe to the gybet to feede Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.</p>
               <p>That which is ſayde of a hundred thouſande handes, hee <hi>anſwereth, that it is meant of a ſubſcription to a ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi> which if it were graunted, yet woulde the ſame bee very ſtrange, if not rebellious. for what is ſuch a ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>but a coniuration, or at least</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">Armatae preces.</note> 
                  <hi>armed prayers?</hi> But ſaith hee, <hi>Martin doeth not there exhort to rebellion.</hi> neyther doe wee charge him with it: but wee ſay, that hee ſpeaketh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly, and that he inſinuateth that puritans, if they ſhould not haue their ſupplication graunted, would either haue gone away diſcontent, or taken part with the enemie, and that the packe of puritans entend rebellion. for that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Firſt by confeſſion of <hi>Martin,</hi> that <hi>inſinuateth they had many ready to maintayne that cauſe, and next by thoſe vagrant rogues that came downe into all ſhires with billes crauing ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is nothing but the beginning of a coniuration. for neuer did ſo many ioyne but in rebellion; nor can ſuch a nomber confederate themſelues without danger to the ſtate. And if the Prince were not exceeding clement, ſhe would teache them the payne of ſubſcriptions, and confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for to obteyne alteration of State: eſpecially when <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> threatneth, <hi>that ſo many would ſtrike a great ſtroke;</hi> which is very true. for ſo many, and leſſe too, being well armed and gouerned, are able to fight with any prince in the worlde. Neyther will it ſerue, that hee ſayeth, <hi>that the ſpeach is Tropologicall:</hi> for it is rather Diabolicall, and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous.</p>
               <p>The wordes of<note n="2" place="margin">Vindiciae con. tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos.</note> 
                  <hi>Iunius Brutus,</hi> that <hi>for the elderſhip ſayth it is lawfull to mooue ſtirres,</hi> are <hi>diſclaymed by the Libeller:</hi> but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knoweth he who is the authour of that booke. for it was made eyther by <hi>Beza,</hi> or <hi>Hotoman,</hi> and conteyneth nothing, but conſiſtoriall doctrine. Neyther doe I thinke, that he will diſclayme T. C. that meaneth to fight ſo ſtoutly, that <hi>if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery hayre of his head were a life, hee woulde afforde them all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18450:50"/>in defence of his platforme:</hi> Nor of <hi>Goodman, Gilby, Whitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the <hi>Geneuians,</hi> without whome this cauſe cannot ſtand. Therefore if the Libeller renounce rebellion, and the doctrine of it, he muſt alſo renounce the nource of rebellion, the Conſiſtorie, and all his deare darlinges, vpon whoſe bare names, as it were vpon emptie barrels, hee buyldeth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtoriall barriquades and bulwarkes.</p>
               <p>Where <hi>they threaten troubles, if they may not haue the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, the Libeller</hi> anſwereth, <hi>that thereby they meane ſcholaſticall troubles, while both partes write concerning diſcipline:</hi> but that cannot be the meaning of the author. for he meant troubles that would enſue, and not which already were. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about diſcipline in writing before that time was at the hotteſt. Neither is there any other ſence to bee drawen out of the wordes, but that great, and bloody ſtirres would be about diſcipline, if the ſame might not otherwiſe be obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. finally, it is the common proceeding of the conſiſtorie, that without wracke and force did neuer enter, either at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> or in <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Scotland.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Th. C.</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticle or ſynode in <hi>Warwickeſhire,</hi> as is ſuppoſed, layde a good foundation. for there the diſcipline was ſet downe: there ſubſcription and promiſe was made, that all miniſters ſhould aduance it by all their power. No doubt they meant as well force, as fayre meanes: for therein they haue neuer bene ſcrupulous.</p>
               <p>Hee anſwereth alſo in defence of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> miniſters: but he ſayth nothing of the Roade of <hi>Ruthuen</hi> and <hi>Sterlinge,</hi> and concealeth moſt dangerous matters, wandring from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in a generalitie of wordes. Hee did not remember that<note n="1" place="margin">A noble precedent of conſiſtoriall excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> 
                  <hi>Galloway</hi> at <hi>Saint Iohnſton</hi> curſed <hi>both the men that ſhould take part with the King, and their horſes and ſpeares:</hi> and how <hi>Iames Gibſon</hi> vſed the King very homely: and how <hi>Iohn Cooper</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to obey the King. And howe <hi>Andrewe Meluin</hi> vſed very tart ſpeeches towarde him: and yet obſtinately refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to acknowledge him ſelfe bounde to anſwere his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18450:50"/>theſe matters the petitioner eyther vnderſtoode not, or would not call to remembrance. hee alſo ſeemeth to bee ignorant, how vpon ſuch like inſolent behauiour, the King tendring certaine articles to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Preachers: as firſt, <hi>that they ſhould yeelde their obedience to the King:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>that they ſhould not pretende Priuiledge:</hi> thirdly, <hi>that they ſhould not meddle in matters of State:</hi> fourthly, <hi>that they ſhould not publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuile his Maieſtie:</hi> that they neuer yeelded to ſubſcribe. A notorious argument of ſinguler inſolencie in them, if it bee as is reported, and ſimplicitie in the petitioner, that going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cleare his cauſe, giueth occaſion of further matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>Where wee alleadge, that <hi>Brutus Iunius,</hi> a Conſiſtoriall writer, or to ſpeake more playnely, <hi>Hotoman,</hi> or <hi>Beza ſayth that the people of themſelues may ſet vp Gods ſeruice, and abrogate ſuperſtition, and that it is lawfull for the people by force of armes to reſiſt the Prince,</hi> if he hinder <hi>the buylding of the Church:</hi> (which theſe men take ſpecially to conſiſt in the elderſhip) And where alſo wee ſet downe many trayterous ſpeeches out of <hi>Goodman, Gilby, Martin, T.C.</hi> and others, the Libeller anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: firſt, <hi>that theſe authors wrote againſt tyrants, and enemies of religion,</hi> as if the pretence of religon were ſufficient to arme the ſubiects to depoſe the prince. wherein is declared, that theſe men accompting thoſe that ſtop the elderſhip enemies of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hold that ſuch princes as hinder the elderſhip may be depoſed alſo: which is an anſwere euill beſeeming a man profeſſing allegiance to her Maieſtie, and pretending to bee of the beſt ſort of ſubiects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee ſaith <hi>that the ſame ſpeeches are alledged by the Papiſtes to condemne our doctrine:</hi> but that anſwere maketh much againſt the Puritans and not vs: for wee condemne both that practiſe and that doctrine, and thoſe that haue giuen ſuch a ſcandale to the Church. They embrace it, and therefore are condemned as perturbers of the State. And albeit nowe they alter their hint, and teache
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18450:51"/>obedience changing faith with time, yet that was their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion once, and I doubt not will bee, as oft as time ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly hee anſwereth, <hi>that the doctrine of the conſiſtorie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not on two, or three:</hi> which we doe not affirme in this cauſe: for we ſay that theſe opinions are generally imbraced of that faction, and of the chiefeſt of them, and that the ſame is ſo ioyned with the conſiſtory, that without the ſame it can not be mainteined. for if the prince bee chiefe gouernour of the church, the conſiſtorie hath no place: and if the conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry haue place, away goeth the princes authoritie in eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall cauſes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly he giueth out, <hi>that our Engliſh biſhops, as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtoriall faction haue rebelled against princes.</hi> which anſwere firſt is not concludent: for the offence of one, is no protection for others: ſecondly, it is falſe. The petitioner ought to haue ſhewed who theſe rebels be: and where their rebellion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by biſhops, ſuch as now we haue. If he cannot ſhew them, wee muſt tell him, <hi>that where hee talketh of fiue hundred traytors, that maintaine the preſent eccleſiasticall gouernement,</hi> hee is out of reaſon, and account, and doeth nothing but rayle, as well beſeemeth his libelling humour. The ſtate and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of biſhops nowe in <hi>England</hi> dependeth externally on the Prince: to him they are ſubiect, and from him they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue lawe: finally, they thinke it vnlawfull to rebell againſt him: condemning all rebellious practiſes, to pull downe his authoritie, and to bring them vnder. but the proud and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conſiſtory claymeth power aboue princes, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth in Eccleſiaſticall matters account to none but God, as they profeſſe, the ſame acknowledgeth it felſe ſubiect to none, and preſcribeth lawes to Princes, yea, teacheth and putteth in practiſe rebellion againſt them: and therefore when there is ſpeach of loyaltie and obedience, let the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller henceforth take heede, how he compareth the moſt,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18450:51"/>factious, and ſuſpicious gouernment to Princes that euer was, to our eccleſiaſticall gouernours, which in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and life cannot bee noted of any diſloyaltie. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally let him holde his peace, and thanke God for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces clemencie. For it is not the innocencie of his Clients, nor the eloquence of the aduocate, that can cleare the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarians from faction. In ſuch bad cauſes, repentance, and ſubmiſſion is beſt defence, the next is ſilence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſely did he paſſe ouer that offence for which <hi>Iohn Vdall</hi> was conuicted, and condemned. Onely this fault hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth herein, that <hi>forgetting howe before hee had promiſed to anſwere for him, now hee leaueth him to anſwere for himſelfe, and like a man that had lost both memorie and wit, runneth out into an idle diſcourſe of othes</hi> Ex Officio, <hi>and an inuectiue againſt Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and furiouſly rayling at the State, calleth ſuch as ſpeake in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, Traitors, and Rebels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To terrifie the Iudges, hee cyteth certaine Textes of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ill fitting his purpoſe. For neither as hee ſayeth, <hi>are his conſortes Saintes, nor doe they ſuffer for holineſſe, nor are they put to death, howſoeuer they deſerue it.</hi> That ſentence of<note n="1" place="margin">Iames 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Iames</hi> rather belongeth to them: <hi>If any man deemeth himſelfe to be religious, and refaineth not his tongue, but ſeduceth his hart, his religion is in vayne:</hi> or that rather, <hi>Woe bee to</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>you Scribes and Phariſes, ye hypocrites, yee are like to whited ſepulchres, faire without, and within full of bones of dead men, and all filthineſſe.</hi> And albeit <hi>Iohn Vdall</hi> had the name vnwothy to be a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: yet neuer any worſe deſerued it, being euery way vnſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; nor tooke a more factious courſe.</p>
               <p>This <hi>fellowe braggeth hee was no murtherer:</hi> yet if hee had proceeded further, I knowe what woulde haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. So arrogant hee is, <hi>that hee imagineth all fooles, but ſuch as like his fancies.</hi> But if <hi>the</hi>
                  <note n="3" place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>Iudges haue ſo little skill in condemning ſuch a Miniſter as</hi> Iohn Vdall: why doth not this great Clarke ſhewe it? this is impudencie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18450:52"/>ſuch reuerend learned men of ignorance, and to ſhewe no reaſon. Beſides this, in lawe there ought to be no reſpect of perſons. Howe then can there bee ſuch difference betwixt miniſters and others, if miniſters offend as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Either this man meaneth to challenge immunitie, or els hee meaneth, if euer he bee a Iudge, to reſpect perſons. Some haue painted <hi>Iuſtice</hi> blinde, but this man woulde haue them iudge with ſpectacles.</p>
               <p>His accuſation againſt ſuch, <hi>as ſpeake</hi> in defence of the ſtate will neuer be prooued. he racketh and teareth their ſayings, as a man lying without conſcience and ſhame, yet will they not reach to his purpoſe. Concerning maſter <hi>Dalton,</hi> whom he <hi>accuſeth as the Biſhops factor,</hi> it is an eaſie matter to anſwere. hee hath more honeſtie, learning, and lawe, then is to be found in all the Puritanes diſtempered braynes. The cauſe he defended was not the Biſhops, but of religion, learning, and the Church.</p>
               <p>Hee chargeth the Biſhops, <hi>that they write in a certaine</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">Admon. a g. M. M. p. 252.</note> 
                  <hi>booke, that it is not lawfull to beſtowe ſuch liuings vpon laye men, as are appoynted by lawe to preachers of the word.</hi> But neither doe the Biſhops ſay it, nor is that booke that is quoted the Biſhops, nor is it likely that ſo graue men had ſo litle to doe, as to buſie themſelues with the anſwering of ſuch a vaine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell as <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Martins</hi> barking ſonnes. But whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the ſaying is, <hi>it is iuſtifiable.</hi> for if the liuings bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted by lawe to preachers, what law is it to infringe law? that the Queene doeth keepe the temporalties of Biſhops in her hands during the vacation; is by law, not againſt law. So likewiſe it is lawfull to holde ſome Eccleſiaſticall liuings that be appropried.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Wiclefs</hi> words againſt the exceſſe of his times, they are euill extended againſt the want of ours, and are voyde of reaſon: for what reaſon is it, <hi>that for the default of one, a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion ſhould be ſpoyled, as he would haue it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſayth hee, who <hi>woulde not thinke the ſuperfluities of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18450:52"/>liuing better beſtowed vpon ſuch a man as</hi> Sir Francis Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham, <hi>that right honourable Chancellour, and benefactor of the Church and Countrey, then vpon any Biſhop.</hi> Wherein hee doeth wrong to the memory of that good knight, and in needeleſſe diſcourſe bringeth his name in queſtion. To his ſuppoſall I anſwere, that there be very wiſe men, that thinke the liuings of Biſhops better as they are, and I thinke hee would ſo ſay, if hee were aliue, and were asked the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. for no man was more deſirous then hee, of true honor: neyther is any thing more diſhonourable, then to riſe by the ſpoyles of the Church, that hee pretendeth to loue: nor to take that to him ſelfe, which was giuen to other vſes. Neyther doe wee reade of any, that hath riſen by the ſpoyles of the Church, that hath long proſpered, or enioyed them: nor haue the Papiſtes any thing to obiect againſt vs more, then ſacriledge and ſpoyle of the Church. As for the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of biſhops, there is order taken. Take foure of the beſt biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> and there will bee found eight knights, euery one whereof ſhall farre ouermatch them in reuenues. Take eight biſhops next in liuing to the greateſt, and there will bee found two hundreth eſquires; euery of which ſhall ouerpaſſe them. diuers yeomen, clownes, and marchantes doe farre excell the reſt. Why then ſhould any enuie to men of learning and qualitie, the eſtate and liuing of knights, eſquires, yeomen and clownes?</p>
               <p>It will bee ſayde, theſe haue it by inheritance; but why ſhould it not, as well be lawfull to haue it, and winne it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, as by inheritance? But I am glad I know why all this while the petitioner barketh ſo loude. Hee woulde haue great men fall to ſpoyling, that hee might light vpon ſome reuerſion, or like a dogge gather vp crummes vnder the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when men ſhall ryot with Churches rapines. well, for his good will, when churches come to be ſpoyled, let him out of the belfray take a rope for his paynes.</p>
               <p>Hee belyeth Doctor <hi>Bridges</hi> ſhamefully: for hee <hi>maketh
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18450:53"/>him to ſay, that a Prieſt may haue a moderate lordly iuriſdiction ouer all the Lordes allotment:</hi> where in trueth hee doeth not ſo much as mention Lordly iuriſdiction, but ſuperioritie: and that ouer the Cleargie in ſeuerall Congregations, and not in the whole Church. Therefore let him make proofe how this ſuperioritie, or maintayning of Churchliuings in their proper ſtate can bee drawen to prooue, that ſuch as defende the ſtate, diffame the Queene, or ſeeeke to mooue inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: If not, let him remember that both hee forgeth, and runneth from his purpoſe, like a babbling diſcourſer wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in a ſea of wordes without compaſſe of ſtyle, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe hee fableth that <hi>Doctor Bancroft writeth, that her Maieſtie is a petie Pope,</hi> which is a graceleſſe or ſhameleſſe aſſertion, or both: for who woulde not bee aſhamed, but theſe ſwelling mindes, that thinke they may ſpeake what they liſt, to aſcribe that to <hi>Maſter Bancroft,</hi> that hee repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth in <hi>Martin?</hi> His wordes are playne, <hi>his minor</hi> (<note n="1" place="margin">Pag. 68.</note> ſaith he, meaning <hi>Martin</hi>) viz. <hi>that her Maieſtie is a pety Pope, may thus bee prooued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Libeller holde on this courſe of lying, hee will prooue many ſtrange and wonderous matters, eſpecially among the Diſciplinarians, whoſe conſiſtories is built on lyes. But, if they diffame her Maieſtie, that holde her to be a pety Pope, as the Libeller by many great wordes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary proofes in a matter confeſſed auoweth: then is <hi>Martin</hi> and his partakers felonious diffamers of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie: for hee holdeth, that <hi>whoſoeuer taketh on him the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in cauſes eccleſiaſticall, which the Pope had, is a petie Pope, as before is ſayde.</hi> But that authority the whole parliament giueth to her Maieſtie. May it therefore pleaſe the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to barke againſt the Parliament, or els againſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi> Againſt Maſter <hi>Bancroft,</hi> that neyther thought it, nor wrote it, nor ſpake it, but reprehendeth it in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Martin,</hi> there is no cauſe for him to declayme.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18450:53"/>all this Libelling notwithſtanding <hi>the petitioner calleth his conſortes our brethren.</hi> but if his brotherhood conſiſt in ſuch ſcurrilous rayling, let him ſeeke other brethren. The brotherhood and felloſhip of Chriſtians is knowen by loue: The badge of puritaniſme is vnnaturall, and vnkinde, and vnbrotherly dealing. And therefore I doubt, whether they be brethren or no, both conſidering their hereticall opinions, and alſo their vncharitable and vnchriſtian rayling. And yet I ſay notwitſtanding all this vnnaturall dealing, that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſo much as they might, yea too too much haue dealt remiſſely againſt ſuch contumatious, and worthleſſe diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church. And that not for any thing which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in this accuſers wtitings, wherein they ſee nothing but velliacry, and preſumption, and vanitie; but in reſpect of their owne milde natures, Chriſtian affection, and deſire of peace: which theſe fellowes ſcorned.</p>
               <p>In the ende hee concludeth, <hi>that conſidering the doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of theſe controuerſies, hee trusteth her Maieſtie will take ſome good order for the peaceable debating of them.</hi> hauing I ſay reuelde at full both againſt eccleſiaſticall, and ciuill iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that before ſo mightie a prince, whoſe preſence he ought more to haue reuerenced: hauing alſo at ſuch time as hee was to ſpeake to her Maieſtie talked againſt all decorum with by ſtanders, yea with thoſe that were abſent, nowe as it were before his death, he commeth home to himſelfe, <hi>and prayeth her Maieſtie to take ſome good courſe for the</hi> peaceable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of theſe controuerſies, as if all her former lawes, all her care, all her proceedings were not to bee valued in one haire: And as if rayling and accuſing deſerued fauour, or his diſpute credite, or his inſolencie, pardon. I doubt not buther Maieſtie of her wiſedome ſeeth the impudencie of the man, the weakeneſſe of the cauſe, the wrong done to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but eſpecially to her ſelfe, her gouernement, and her lawes-that others may ſee it, I haue lightly framed this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, leſt the foole ſhould enter into conceipt of his wit,

                  <hi>and others: I haue thought good briefly &amp; truly to deliuer the opinions of ſuch as ſue for reformation, which I haue gathered out of their bookes, and ſeene in their practiſe, and heard in conference which I had with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither hath the man deliuered his conſorts opinions tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> nor was it ſufficient, if hee had meant to cleare them from ſlander, to deliuer ſome part of their opinions, vnleſſe he had alſo deliuered their whole doctrine concerning their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtoriall diſcipline. for what excuſe may it bee for an here-tike, to beleeue well in ſome poyntes: or for leude men to doe ſomething well? But this generall doctrine of theirs, neyther doth he, nor durſt hee deliuer: it was ſomewhat too hoat and ſawcie. The ſoueraigntie of the aldermen in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lawes, iudging and excommunicating princes, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the lawes of the land, taking away her Maieſties preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in pardoning offences, and depriuing her of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe hath to ſhewe her clemencie in, in diminiſhing her reuenues, hee concealeth: Neither doth hee reueale vnto vs thoſe myſticall rules, whereby the conſiſtoriall faction doth

That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which hee wanteth, to the intent (that wee may haue a perfect draught of the aleſtond of this newe brewed diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,) I purpoſe to ſet down, and to declare vnto you, both their doctrine, and their practiſe. So that you may perceiue that they are vainely tearmed ſeekers, and ſewers for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: And that the cauſe wee defende, is not the cauſe of biſhops, whom we leaue to defend their doings themſelues; but the cauſe of God, of religion, of our countrey, of the prince, of learning, of the whole miniſterie, againſt factious mates, and heretical ſchiſmatikes, and enemies of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, &amp; learning, that in theſe dangerous times, go about to make an vproare in their countrey, and a ſpoyle of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of learning.

This fellowe therefore is the onely ſinguler doctor of diſcipline, that giueth cognition of appeales from ſynodes to the prince. But marke I pray you the ridiculous ignorance of this ſimple fellowe. firſt he would haue the appeale from the ſynode, or particuler congregation in the firſt inſtance: And yet euery man may ſee that the firſt inſtance was, where the cauſe was firſt begunne, that is, in the pariſh or conſiſtorie, and not before the ſynode: Secondly he wil not ſay, that any man may appeale in the laſt inſtance, for that were too much, as hee thinketh: ſo that ſtill running on in the diſloyall tunes of puritanes, hee taketh from the prince the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18450:61"/>laſt cognition, and giueth it to his ſynodes.</p>

               <p>If euery man might liue as he liſt,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> ſo hee coloured his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with Gods word and Chriſtes commandement, there would neyther papiſt, nor other heritike be repreſſed. for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man maketh religion and Chriſts commandement a couer for his pretences. But gladly would I, he ſhould anſwere me this queſtion; whither hee doth thinke that none doe liue as becommeth Churches of Chriſt, but ſuch as haue his dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt deuiſes of elders; and their doltiſh gouernement? if hee anſwere ſo, as here he ſeemeth, then muſt I tell him, that there can be no greater ſlander of this ſtate, or of her Maieſtie, and the gouernement. If not, what doth he tell vs here of people capable, and willing to liue as becommeth the Churches of Chriſt, as if the people of England were neither capable, nor willing ſo to liue? Againe, let him tell mee in good ſooth, whither hee doth beleeue, that the conſiſtorie, and newe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline thereto belonging was in deede commaunded by Chriſt: and if hee beleeue it, let him ſhewe the place, and the words of the commandement, and declare what father euer ſo thought. if he beleeue it, and cannot bring forth any place, but wreſted: he will be taken for a man building his faith on ſand: and ſhal be had forth for a forger, and deuiſer of ſtrange nouelties, and condemned in amendes for making leaſings of his conſiſtorie.</p>

               <p>But we looke for proofe,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> not for proteſtations, the vanitie whereof is too too apparant in the puritanes: proofes muſt cary away the matters, and not brags. But proofes can they bring none, for wee haue ſhewed that both ſcriptures, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are againſt them: and nothing can they ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18450:61"/>yet haue they bin heard to the wearineſſe of al their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; ſcorne of their diſcipline, and ſhame of their actions. neither is it to be preſumed, that they can ſpeake better then they haue written, nor will performe more, then they haue done, or any part of that they haue promiſed. they haue none that taketh part with them in this cauſe, but the <hi>Geneuians</hi> and their followers. whether theſe be to be heard againſt all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, let all men iudge. and therefore if they be wiſe, let them take heed, that their cauſe come not in hearing: for then both the noueltie, fondneſſe, and iniuſtice of it, of euery reaſonable man will be condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the ſomme of their profeſſed opinions, and reformation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Petitioner.</note>
               </p>
               <p>No reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by your leaue: neither any perfect ſomme:<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> for there wanteth a good part of all. for the chiefe poynt that they deſire, is that biſhops liuings, &amp; cathedral churches may come to diuiſion, that theſe hungry hines that haue ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their wits, &amp; wealth in vanity, may now be relieued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſacriledge.</p>
               <p>Next to this, they deſire that certaine factious mates vnder the name of elders may haue the diſpoſing of all eccleſiaſtical matters, that when the firſt ſpoiles of churches are ſpent, they may by their elderly wiſdome command, &amp; worke the ſacke of the Nobility alſo. They would alſo, if they durſt ſpeake it, craue that the Prince, Parliament, Counſel, &amp; Iudges would giue ouer their charges in eccleſiaſtical matters, that their ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes &amp; conſiſtories, &amp; people might either rule as they liſt, or liue as they liſt. A ſmall point in theſe mens conceits: may it therefore at theſe mens requeſts pleaſe her Maieſtie and all officers to giue vp their eſtate, that theſe new lords may rule?</p>
               <p>Fourthly they deſire that all lawes that make againſt them, being abrogated, their word may be accounted good law: and that all law may proceed out of their diuine breſts. and good reaſon: for like yong <hi>Popillions</hi> they ſay, that they iudge in Chriſtes ſeate, and ſit as Chriſtes vicars, and that their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is Chriſtes ſentence: and yet is the ſame no more but the conceit of foure, or ſiue beetleheaded Clownes, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18450:62"/>guided by one blinde man that neuer looked out of ſchooles, called by them, paſtor, &amp; preſident of the conſiſtory.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, they ſeeke the ouerthrow of the ſtate, of religion, of learning: they would make the prince ſubiect to themſelues, and diſpoſe of her reuenues and crowne.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they deſire that all artes, and ſtudie of diuinitie cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, only me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would profeſſe diſcipline, which is that diuine ſtate, as they thinke, which <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaketh of in his vtopicall common wealth: and theſe are their opinions for gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Their opinions for doctrine are alſo diuers, &amp; very dangerous to the ſtate, &amp; hereticall in reſpect of chriſtian faith, as before I haue in part noted. put both together: there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either wiſe or learned, or loyall to the State, that will eyther yeelde to graunt them their deſires, or els to heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> motioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo vnreaſonable. Neither is it true, that hee ſaith, <hi>that men doe intollerably ſlaunder his conſorts.</hi> their wordes beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, their writings and doings conuince them, neither ſhall they euer be able to cleare themſelues. I haue not alledged any thing without reaſon: why then do they not cleare their deuiſes accuſed of falſhood, imperfection, and notorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice? why did not this author, if hee meant good dealing, ſet his name to his booke? how can he excuſe himſelfe, either for his libelling, or ſlaundering? his excuſe is moſt wicked: <hi>marueile not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>good reader, that I doe not affixe my name to this my Treatiſe: it is not knowen who was the writer of the epiſtle to the Hebrewes.</hi> As if that epiſtle were to bee compared to this Libell, or the author thereof to this raylor: nothing is more contrary. It is well knowen, that that epiſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the ſpirite of God: this dogrell treatiſe is knowen to be deuiſed by Satan the ſower of contention, and lewde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, among brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The writer of that epiſtle is not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; yet no man doubteth of the authoritie of it. The writer of this Libel is wel knowen; I would he ſo well knewe himſelfe. His bedlem fits alſo, and helpers he had in his writing, are knowen. A childe may ſee that in the whole there is neither
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18450:62"/>wit, nor learning, nor ought but friuolous rayling, and libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſlaundering, and therefore no man giueth any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit or commendation to it. But this it pleaſed him to alledge, becauſe <hi>Th. Cartwright</hi> alledgeth the ſame excuſe for not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his name to his firſt reply. Let them therefore bee put both together, for they are byrdes both of one plumage and qualitie: and percaſe if they write bookes whereto they dare not affixe their names, may haue their eares affixed, where they would be aſhamed.</p>
               <p>He alledgeth further, <hi>that no indifferent welwiller may ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be heard to ſpeake the trueth,</hi> charging her Maieſtie, and the gouernours not onely with notorious iniuſtice, but alſo with reſiſtance to the trueth: and that moſt vntruely, and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. for her Maieſtie hath but too much heard them ſpeake, albeit againſt trueth: yea, againſt her dignitie and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuffred their Legendicall tales of their elderſhips: of which if they were not aſhamed, they would not flie the light like owles, nor walke abroade in libels in the night, like night walkers, &amp; other euil diſpoſed perſons: nor would they ſend vs forth ſuch fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticke &amp; lunatike perſons, as this author, that barketh at euery ſhadowe: yea, at ſhadowes in moone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, to ſpeak for this glorious cauſe, as they cal it. nor <hi>would he deſire men to hide him, as</hi> Rahab <hi>did hide Gods ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,</hi> wherein he doeth ſhamefully abuſe this whole State, comparing the ſame to <hi>Iericho,</hi> and the Magiſtrates to the wicked <hi>Cananites,</hi> accompting onely thoſe that are of his faction for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Would we ſuffer ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumelious ſpeeches, yet all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity will cry ſhame on theſe raylors, &amp; I doubt not but the Magiſtrates wil conſider of them. In the meane while, let him vnderſtande, that this example fitteth him not: for <hi>Rahab</hi> did hide no libellers nor railers againſt the ſtate: nor are the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth ſo honeſt as <hi>Rahab:</hi> nor is it a ſeemely mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſuch a braue challenger to make a brag, &amp; ſo to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: nor decency for him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> preferreth a ſupplication to the Queene, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kneeleth before her Maieſtie, to hide himſelfe &amp;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18450:63"/>his name: nor can it ſtand together, that a man ſhould kneele before her Maieſtie, and yet conceale his name and perſon.</p>
               <p>He promiſeth <hi>when his apparance ſhall be found more profitable, then his concealement, that he wil come forth, and try himſelfe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per man:</hi> but he had beſt come forth in time, leſt if, as he ſaith, he be in concealement, ſome one or other begge him of the Queene: for to her belong both concealements, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie of Ideots. He braggeth, <hi>that he williuſtifie his wordes in ſuch maner and forme, as he hath written them:</hi> but goodman, he neither vnderſtandeth what he hath written, nor hath furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor ſtuffe in him for ſo hard an encounter. for hee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more of <hi>Luna,</hi> then <hi>Mars,</hi> and is rather lunaticall, then martiall. It is not long ſince his Bedlem fits left him. Of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke he hath no taſte, nor yet of Diuinitie: why then ſhould he like a deſperate ſotte, or like a man without armes, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of warre venture into ſo dangerous a battell? His good maſters are quite fled out of the fielde, and all their newe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinarian deuiſes are vaniſhed away like cloudes, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaine in certaine idle mens braynes, who may in time percaſe diſgeſt them: and therefore if this ſentence <hi>nubecula eſt, citò tranſibit,</hi> pleaſe him; let him write it vpon the doore of the conſiſtory: for like a cloude it hath bene lift vp, and like a cloude it hath bene toſſed with contrary opinions, and like a cloude it is almoſt vaniſhed away.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the petition. Now let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Articles and Queſtions: not that they conteine any new matter, (for both his petition, articles, and interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries proceede from the ſame malice, and tende to one ende, and conteine the ſame odious accuſations againſt the State) but for that wee meane not to leaue vnto theſe men any ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or pretence for their cauſe. If the ſame things bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated; blame him that ſo often obiected the ſame, not them that anſwere their calumnious and vayne obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. accuſations are often odious: defence of orders and lawes cannot but fauourably be eſteemed.</p>

For nothing is more ordinarie, then to reuerſe prohibitions by conſultations. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wordes of <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> or rather of the Regiſter, whence he drewe his writte, was: That men ſhould not bee called into eccleſiaſticall courtes to confirme any contract concerning goods or chattels by othe: by which meanes, the eccleſiaſtical court encroched vpon other courtes. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſes Matrimoniall and Teſtamentarie in that caſe (for to other it cannot bee extended) were excepted. That in matter of Tithes, and other cauſes men anſwered vpon their othes, is euident; for that the<note n="1" place="margin">Art. Cler. 9.

For they marre and abuſe many good texts of ſcripture, &amp; fill the peoples eares with nouelties, and want diſcretion to profit them either in faith or maners. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they make none vnpreaching miniſters, but giue euerie one licence to announce the worde by reading, and priuate admonition, albeit not by publique expoſition.

And who woulde not deteſt him, that would make a doubt, whether theſe diſciplinarians be impious and flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fellowes that affirme it to be lawfull to make doubts and queſtions in thoſe caſes?

But in vaine doth he feed himſelf with his owne conceit. For I anſwere, and will ſhewe, that our liturgie and ceremonies agree neerer to the liturgie and ceremonies of the primitiue Church, then to the popiſh orders. And that is apparent, firſt in quality: for that wee haue purged out all idolatrie &amp; ſuperſtition, &amp; falſe doctrine, in which the papiſts do moſt differ from the ancient Church. Secondly, in forme. For as the Iewes had readings of the law, &amp; certaine hymnes and prayers interpoſed: ſo no doubt the Apoſtles kept the reading of ſcriptures, with prayers interpoſed: which forme we keepe. the papiſts keepe not. The papiſts reade no ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and haue other formes of prayers. Thirdly, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, for as in ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time, ſo now we vſe our mother to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue. Nay, further, we come neerer in our formes to the primitiue church, then the conſiſtorial orders. For they haue no ſet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſcrptures nor forme of liturgie, as they had in the times of the firſt fathers, and are ſo vnlike them, that they haue abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed al the orders of the ancient Church. They haue no ſet praiers, but leaue al to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſcretion of their ſpeaker, as they cal him: who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiueth prayers either ſo confuſed that they are not vnderſtood, or ſo vncharitable, that a true Chriſtian may not ſay Amen. Contrariwiſe, ancient counſels decreed, that no praiers ſhould bee ſaid in the church, but ſuch as firſt ſhould by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon authority be allowed. And albeit, apparel is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indifferent, yet in publike liturgie, wee come neerer to the Apoſtolike Church: whereas the puritanes haue aboliſhed al Apoſtolike orders, as they haue aboliſhed al Apoſtolike go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement. To the laſt part of the queſtion, whether po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ceremonies bee more decent then Apoſtolicall: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that where they are contrarie, there the Apoſtolike is more decent. But I denie, that eyther the newe conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall gouernement, or the ceremonies by the ſame appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are Apoſtolicall: or that our ceremonies are papiſticall.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18450:85"/>Nay I ſay, that their newe orders are not Apoſtolicall, but fantaſticall, and that our gouernement is Apoſtolicall. ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they euer be able to prooue the contrary.</p>

                  <p>Whether they giue offence to the papiſtes or no,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> wee are not to reſpect, nor to omit ancient and Apoſtolike orders to pleaſe them. To good men the vſe of our ceremonies cannot giue iuſt offence. Nay rather, the confuſion of the newe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and abſurditie in the newe liturgie giueth offence. for it confirmeth the papiſts in their opinion, and offendeth all that are comming forward to ioyne with vs. For they ſee not how that can be the Church that refuſeth all ancient go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement and ceremonies, and is nothing but a bundell of nouelties.

                  <p>Firſt it is denied,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> that the attyre of miniſters in England now, is condemned by the Queenes iniunctions, or biſhops articles, or doctrine of England.

And neuer ſhall this bold bayardlike <hi>Putcaſe</hi> prooue them, either to be monumentes of poperie, or defiled with idolatrie: let him begin when he wil.

And farre was <hi>master Lambert</hi> from his recknoning, when he imagined the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Hugo</hi> to bee author of that name.

Chriſt did not refuſe to anſwere directly, and confeſſed, that he was the ſonne of God. Theſe ſtand not vpon their innocencie, but vpon tearmes of lawe. Neyther doth the example of our Sauiour fit them. For hee being asked of his doctrine in generall, coulde not otherwiſe anſwere then in generall: Theſe refuſe to anſwere in particular poyntes, which he did neuer: and therefore iuſtly were committed. A matter iuſtifiable both by the lawes of God, &amp; alſo the lawes ciuill, canon, and common. If being to anſwere in the Starre Chamber or Chancerie vnto certaine articles, they ſhoulde anſwere, That they deliuered nothing but publikely, and will the examiner to aſke them that heard and ſaw, they would bee ſent to other places to aduiſe vpon the matter. Further I ſay, it will not fall out in proofe, that thoſe men which haue bene conuented before the high Commiſſioners in cauſes eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, are either godly or wiſe, or miniſters: &amp; therefore falſe it is, that he affirmeth them to bee godly miniſters, and very ſcandalous to the ſtate, whom he ſetteth forth as a ſtate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Chriſt Ieſus: whereas in deed theſe men by defacing the Church, and the gouernours thereof, by teaching of erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious doctrine, and by raiſing of ſtirres about a new gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was neuer heard of in Chriſts Church, do ſhew themſelues enemies of Chriſt, of his Church, and of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and therefore together with <hi>Iohnſon</hi> of whom themſelues are now aſhamed, to bee caſt out of the Church, vnleſſe they ſhew more ſignes of amendment.</p>

Onely this thing is herein commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that puritans &amp; papiſtes are very fitly ioyned together in this caſe.

And how baſtards may be gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in lawful wedlocke, he wil hardly define, conſidering the Common law, which ſaieth, that all children borne in matrimonie, the husband being <hi>Intra quatuor maria,</hi> are lawfull. For my part, ſo that adulterie and fomication bee puniſhed ſeuerely, I doe not care. That the ſtatute doeth not hinder the eccleſiaſtical Iudges proceeding it is euident: for that there is no clauſe to annull his courſe, neither is it the intendement of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to fauour ſuch lewde perſons.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18450:93"/>Yet thus much I anſwere further; Firſt, that if the Iudge could not call witneſſes before him, there would bee no triall nor proofe in matters of doubt. Secondly, that in diuers crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſes, both Gods lawes, and the lawes of this realme doe require, that the partie anſwere vpon his othe. Thirdly, that there lyeth no prohibition: for that the Ordinarie dealeth in cauſes orderly, and according to warrant of lawe. Neither is it reaſon that the Eccleſiaſticall Iudges ſhould ceaſe doing of iuſtice, againſt all the perturbers of this Church, becauſe there was ſometimes one matter depending in the Starre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber againſt ſome fewe of them. For where the eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Iudge is prohibited to proceede in one cauſe, yet doth he notwithſtanding proceede in others of like nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other parties. Much rather then ought they to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, not being prohibited, and in caſes that are diuerse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially now, that the cotumacious dealing of the Puritans, is by the iudgement of the reuerend Iudges and moſt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lawers in England, condemned, and the cauſe now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the courte, and diuers conſultations brought, after prohibitions graunted out of ſome courts in that cauſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I thinke, that either maiſter <hi>Cooke,</hi> a man too lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to knowe, and two wiſe to fauour ſuch perturbers of the ſtate, as the ſeare, or any Iudge or learned lawyer, wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the proceedings of eccleſiaſticall courtes in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as being contrary to lawe. The writte in the Regiſter, which ſeemeth to giue leaue to Ordinaries to ſweare men in cauſes Teſtamentarie and Matrimoniall is proued to be miſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrued by <hi>Fitzherbert.</hi> For otherwiſe that writte ſhould be contrarie to infinite other lawes. Vpon this error, what maruell is it, if <hi>Crompton,</hi> a man of no iudgement, hath bene deceaued, ſeeing <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> hath alſo miſtaken ſuch matters. Neither is it maruell, that lawyers ſpeaking for their cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, doe ſpeake otherwiſe then lawe. For neuer before this time was it heard, that the pleading of lawyers ſhoulde be accounted to be lawe, further then they bring lawe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Contrariwiſe the conſiſtorie draweth no authoritie from the prince, but contendeth with the prince about ſupreme authoritie. It giueth lawe to the prince: it doth chaſtiſe and iudge the prince: vnder colour of the breach of Gods lawe, it doth encroch vpon all cauſes, and controlleth all that are ſubiects to Gods lawe, whereof the ſame doth take it ſelfe to be iudge.

As for that which this <hi>Putcaſe</hi> alledgeth, that the Archbiſhop giueth the prince diſpenſations vnder his hand and ſeale, it is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

                  <p>To theſe three queſtions,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> which are the very criſis of the <hi>Put caſe</hi> dreaming furie, I anſwere firſt, that ſeeing the prince by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of God is ſoueraine gouernour in all cauſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her dominions, that beſide the ordinary iuriſdiction of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops within their ſeuerall Dioceſſe, it is very requiſite that there ſhould bee a ſuperiour authoritie to aſſiſt them, and to ſtrengthen them, and to ſupply that which is wanting, and in caſe they doe not their dueties, to correct them: ſecondly, that as the Prince is one, ſo there ought to bee but one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authoritie, although by that authoritie her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie may appoynt diuers Commiſſioners: and yet nothing commeth thereby to the Elderſhip that claymeth authoritie not from the prince, but from God, and would altogether
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18450:102"/>breake the vnion of her gouernement, while euery conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie would rule the congregation vnder it, as beſt pleaſeth my lords the church aldermen.</p>
                  <p>As for the gradation of the libeller, if hee had vnderſtoode any logicke, he might haue learned, that no kind of argument is more faultie by this reaſon a man might thus conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the libeller, that if he will libell againſt authoritie, hee will not ſpare the counſell, if they withſtande him; if not the counſell, neither will he ſpare the prince: if hee contemne all humane lawes, he will not greatly eſteeme Gods lawes; if hee care not for Gods lawe, then will he not in the ende care for God himſelfe. likewiſe if the <hi>Sanedrin</hi> was at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then in other cities; if in cities, then in boroughs, &amp; ſo in villages: and if the conſiſtory be required in pariſhes, then in villages, if in villages, then in hamlets; if in hamlets, then in houſes; if in houſes then in the kitchin, where the cooke is chiefe mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator which followe as well as his reaſons. many doe thinke that one high commiſſion is inough &amp; too much for al Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: what then woulde they thinke, if they ſhould ſee in euery pariſh high commiſſioners? yea what if there were but ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners as the aldermen of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſtonie be, that claime a moſt abſolute &amp; high commiſſion from God, planted in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery pariſh? it would then be time to runne into ſome other countrey <hi>à remotis.</hi> for it would bee hard liuing. in England. thirdly, I ſay that there is no place in England capable of the aldermanſhippe, but ſuch as is very capable of faction, and diſloyalty: and that his reaſon drawen from organs, and broken muſicke is very weake. for albeit there is broken muſicke in ſome places, and not in other: yet can there be no elderſhips in any place. for if any ſhould bee placed, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke of that companie compared with other places woulde ſound like a paire of broken organes, not onely like broken muſicke. and that gouernment would breake both Church and common wealth in pieces, &amp; bring all out of tune. they haue done it already in places where they be ſetled: and were

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas in the former diſcourſe ſomewhat hath bene ſaid in anſwere of the Petitioners lewd ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations concerning the triall of <hi>Iohn Vdal,</hi> and the iudgement not long ſince pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which he pretendeth to be diſorderlie and iniurious, it may be that ſuch as list to cauill at ſuch things as they miſlike, will take exceptions against the ſame, as if I meant to abaſe the high authoritie of Iudges, or make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the higheſt courtes of Iuſtice an argument for the rude populaſſe to diſpute of, or to ſubiect the ordinarie trials of law to the controlment, or at leaſt canuaſes of priuate perſons. Leaſt any ſhould either in this behalfe except against me, or enter into any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of me, I thought good expreſly here to aduertiſe thee, that both my words and meaning are contrary.</p>
            <p>Concerning matters of common Iuſtice betwixt partie and partie, I know that no iudgement is reuerſed but by writ of errour, and that in matters concerning the Crowne, the verdicts of Iurors and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Iudges for the Queene are finall, and that the lawe doeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that Iudges and Iurors will proceede with that indifferencie and equitie, that it will not haue their doings controlled nor exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by priuate perſons. Neither is it any part of my meaning to call any law in question, or controll the doings of ſo honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as in that fact ſate Iudges. Nay this is the thing which I doe ſo much reprehend in the Petitioner and his faction, that most ſaucilie and arrogantly they take vpon them to examine the doings of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the actes of Parliament, the ſentences of Iudges, the verdicts of Iuries, and all recordes of Iuſtice. Neither is there any companion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſo baſe, but he taketh to himſelfe libertie to cenſure and controll Princes, Parliaments, Iudges, Lawes, yea whatſoeuer, and whomſoeuer. Among others, the author of the Petition hath beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe as preſumptuouſlie and proudly, as the beſt. Ignorance
<pb facs="tcp:18450:116"/>belike maketh him bolde:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the rather for that it is ioyned with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie. What through preſumption, and what through impudencie he hath taken vpon him contrary to the Iurors verdict and Iudges ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to prooue <hi>that Vdall offended not againſt that ſtatute of 23. Eliz. cap. 2.</hi> whereupon he was condemned.</p>
            <p>This notorious impudencie and preſumption, I thought good to lay open before mens eyes: and therefore hauing vndertaken to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere others of the mans bold aſſertions and forged accuſations of the eccleſiaſticall ſtate; I thought it not amiſſe withall to touch his bolde demeanour against Iudges, and preſumptuous cenſure of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Not that I meant to make priuate men Iudges of their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, but that you may ſee the boldneſſe of them that ſpare none that are not of their humors, and reuell both at the Clergie and Iudges.</p>
            <p>If the proceedings of magiſtrates were not iustifiable, yet is this courſe which theſe men haue taken very lewd and offenſiue. How much more offenſiue then will it ſeeme, when it appeareth that the Iudges haue proceeded according to lawe, and done not onely Iustice, but ſhewed great mercie and fauour to the partie? And how wiſelie doeth this man ſeeme to haue pleaded for his client, when I thinke himſelfe will not denie, but that hee liueth rather by mercy, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merite? that he was moſt fauourably dealt withall, all that were by will witneſſe, and himſelfe I thinke will not denie: if he ſhould, very many arguments would conuince him.</p>
            <p>For firſt, whereas diuers ſeditious Sermons might haue bene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected againſt him, he was onely endited for his ſeditious practiſes in making and publiſhing the booke of Demonſtration of Diſcipline, as they lewdly call it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas <hi>Chatfield</hi> could haue ſpoken diuers things very materiall againſt him, yet was he not forced to come to teſtifie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, being by diuers witneſses, and great euidence, ſufficient to induce any Iury to paſse againſt him, conuinced, yet had he this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to be asked, for ſatisfying the Iury, and clearing himſelfe, if he would take it either vpon his conſcience, yea or credite, that he was not the author of that booke, and might percaſe haue eſcaped, if he
<pb facs="tcp:18450:116"/>durſt haue denied ſo plaine a matter. Seeing he would neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vpon his conſcience, nor credite, his innocencie, what reaſon ſhould the Iury haue had, to take that vpon their conſcience, which the partie himſelfe would not take either vpon his conſcience, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, although the ſentence of law be paſsed vpon him, yet is the execution of lawe differred. Wherein if he doe not acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fauourably dealt withall, all men will acknowledge, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth litle fauour.</p>
            <p>The obiections and exceptions brought by the Libeller, are moſt falſe, and friuolous. He ſaith, <hi>that there is no offence in writing that booke, committed againſt the ſtatute of 23.</hi> Eliz. cap. <hi>2.</hi> Wherein he croſſeth the ſentence of the Iudges, and moſt wiſe men of this lande: and ſpeaketh moſt euident vntrueth. For if railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her Maieſties Eccleſiaſticall lawes, and gouernment, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſubuerſion of it, be no offence, theſe fellowes challenge to themſelues great impunitie and licence.</p>
            <p>He auoweth, <hi>that it was not prooued that one man made the booke, and the Epiſtle before the booke,</hi> which is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall: for if he writte the wordes conteined in the enditement, then was the enditement truely found. Beſides, the ſame is vntrueth: for it is abſurd to ſurmiſe, where a man publiſheth a booke, that another ſetteth to the Epistle. and he that made the Epiſtle, doeth in termes auowe the booke. Neither skilleth it, that ſome haue thought that <hi>Penry</hi> had his hand in it, for that doeth not hinder, but that <hi>Vdal</hi> might alſo be a doer in it. But what neede we other argument to prooue this withall, then that <hi>Vdal</hi> would not diſauow either Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or booke? or what neede any diſpute about the difference of the Epiſtle, and booke, ſeeing the enditement compriſeth both vnder the name of booke, and both doe followe the title?</p>
            <p>That which he ſaith, <hi>that he was conuicted for the Epiſtle, and the euidence brought for the booke,</hi> is vntrue: for the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was brought for both. And very improbable it were, that any ſhould be condemned for matter without the enditement, or that
<pb facs="tcp:18450:117"/>there ſhould in the enditement be made a difference betwixt the booke and the Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, let all men iudge whether it be likely, that <hi>Iohn Vdal</hi> ſhould be condemned guiltleſſe? and whether the bare affirmation of a man lying deſperately, ſhould be taken againſt the depoſition of witneſſes, recordes of the Court, verdict of the Iury, and ſentence of ſo graue and religious a Bench, eſpecially the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo guilty, and the caſe ſo plaine? His very friendes condemned him, and his owne conſcience accuſed him.<note place="margin">Chatfields depoſition.</note> 
               <hi>Chatfield</hi> depoſeth, <hi>that he ſawe papers in</hi> Vdals <hi>Studie, conteining libellous matter, which himſelfe wiſhed</hi> Vdal <hi>to make away:</hi> and confeſſeth, that Vdal <hi>ſaide to him in choller, that the Biſhops had beſt to take heede howe they ſtopped his mouth, for if they did, he would fall on writing, and giue them ſuch a blowe, as they neuer had in their liues.</hi> Which blowe could not be vnderſtoode, but of that whereof he was conuicted. In his Sermons he fell often vpon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his booke, which conſidered, with other circumſtances, may ſhewe him guiltie: yea, and ſo guiltie, that being demanded by the Bench, he could not deny it: no, though he might haue ſaued his life by the deniall, and renunciation of the booke.</p>
            <p>Seeing then all this notwithstanding, the mans innocencie is in a booke (publikely diuulgued) defended againſt ſuch notorious euidence, and vpright proceedings; who doeth not ſee, that I haue reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the notorious preſumption of ſuch cenſors? If any deſerue blame, not they that ſpeake in defence of iuſtice, but thoſe that traduce it are to be blamed. That therefore which was well meant, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to any, receiue with fauour: and if in this matter thou wilt ſhewe ſignes of diſpleaſure, let not the innocent, but ſuch as preſumptuouſly reprehend, and by faction ſeeke to ouerthrowe lawe, and iustice, feele it.</p>
